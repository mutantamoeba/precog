# position_management.yaml - Position Management & Risk
# ============================================
# This file controls how we manage OPEN positions after entry.
# Think of this as "portfolio management" - it's not just about
# placing trades, but actively managing them to maximize returns
# and minimize risk.
#
# Version: "2.0" (Phase 0.5 Enhancements)
# Last Updated: 2025-10-21
# Major Changes: Added dynamic monitoring, exit priorities,
#                urgency-based execution from Phase 5 design
# ============================================

# ============================================
# PORTFOLIO LIMITS
# ============================================
# Maximum risk across ALL positions combined.
# WHY: Individual positions might be safe, but too many
# creates portfolio risk.

portfolio:
  # Maximum number of open positions at once
  # WHY: More positions = more monitoring, more complexity
  # BEGINNER: Start with 5, increase as comfortable
  max_open_positions: 10

  # Maximum total capital deployed across all positions
  # WHY: Even if Kelly says bet more, don't overextend
  max_total_capital_deployed: "10000.00"

  # Maximum correlated exposure (positions that move together)
  # WHY: If all positions tied to "Chiefs win", and Chiefs lose,
  # you lose everything. Diversification is key.
  max_correlated_exposure: "3000.00"  # Max $3k in correlated positions

  # Concentration limits by sport
  # WHY: Don't put all eggs in NFL basket
  max_exposure_by_sport:
    nfl: "0.60"  # 60% of portfolio max
    nba: "0.40"  # 40% of portfolio max
    mlb: "0.30"
    nhl: "0.20"
    soccer: "0.20"
    tennis: "0.20"

  # Concentration limits by game
  # WHY: Don't have 5 positions all on same game
  max_positions_per_game: 3
  max_exposure_per_game: "1500.00"

# ============================================
# POSITION MONITORING (Phase 5 Enhancement)
# ============================================
# CRITICAL CONCEPT: Dynamic monitoring frequency
# WHY: Balance responsiveness with API rate limits
# - Normal mode (30s): Standard tracking for stable positions
# - Urgent mode (5s): Fast checks when near critical thresholds
#
# EXAMPLE: Position at +10% profit → check every 30s (normal)
#          Position within 2% of stop loss → check every 5s (urgent)
#          This prevents hitting API rate limits while catching critical events

monitoring:
  # PHASE 5: Dynamic Monitoring Frequencies
  # ========================================
  # How often to check position status?
  # WHY: API limits = 100 calls/10s (600/min), we use 60/min max
  #      With 20 positions: 40 calls/min normal, 60 calls/min all urgent

  normal_frequency: 30      # user-customizable: Seconds between checks (normal conditions)
  urgent_frequency: 5       # user-customizable: Seconds between checks (urgent conditions)

  # URGENT MODE TRIGGERS
  # When to switch from 30s → 5s checking?
  # WHY: Don't want to miss stop loss or profit target by checking too slowly
  urgent_conditions:
    near_stop_loss_pct: "0.02"      # user-customizable: Within 2% of stop loss = urgent
    near_profit_target_pct: "0.02"  # user-customizable: Within 2% of profit target = urgent
    near_trailing_stop_pct: "0.02"  # user-customizable: Within 2% of trailing stop = urgent

  # EXAMPLE: Position down 13%, stop loss at -15%
  #          → Within 2% of stop → Switch to 5s checks
  #          This gives us 6 chances to catch the exact stop loss
  #          vs. 1 chance with 30s checking

  # API RATE MANAGEMENT
  # ==================
  # WHY: Kalshi has rate limits, we must stay under them
  price_cache_ttl_seconds: 10        # Cache market prices for 10s (reduces API calls ~66%)
  max_api_calls_per_minute: 60       # Safety limit (NOT user-customizable - system constraint)

  # What to check on each update?
  checks:
    - "current_price"        # Market price changed?
    - "unrealized_pnl"       # Calculate current P&L
    - "trailing_stop"        # Update trailing stop if needed
    - "exit_conditions"      # Check all 10 exit conditions
    - "edge_status"          # Edge still there?
    - "correlation"          # Correlation with other positions?
    - "time_to_settlement"   # How long until settled?
    - "liquidity"            # Can we exit if needed?

  # Health scoring
  # WHY: Quantify how "healthy" each position is
  # Score = weighted sum of factors
  health_score:
    enabled: true
    factors:
      edge_remaining: "0.40"       # 40% weight
      time_remaining: "0.20"       # 20% weight
      liquidity_depth: "0.20"      # 20% weight
      unrealized_pnl: "0.20"       # 20% weight

    # Health thresholds
    # WHY: Trigger actions based on health
    very_healthy: "0.80"  # 80+ = great position
    healthy: "0.60"       # 60-80 = okay
    concerning: "0.40"    # 40-60 = watch closely
    unhealthy: "0.20"     # 20-40 = consider exit
    critical: "0.00"      # 0-20 = exit immediately

# ============================================
# EXIT PRIORITY HIERARCHY (Phase 5 Enhancement)
# ============================================
# CRITICAL CONCEPT: Not all exits are equally urgent
# WHY: If stop loss AND profit target both trigger, which do we execute?
#      Priority hierarchy resolves conflicts
#
# PRIORITY LEVELS:
# - CRITICAL (1): Capital protection - execute immediately with market orders
# - HIGH (2): Risk management - execute quickly with aggressive limits
# - MEDIUM (3): Profit taking - execute with fair limits
# - LOW (4): Optimization - execute with conservative limits
#
# EXAMPLE: Position triggers both "stop_loss" (CRITICAL) and "early_exit" (LOW)
#          → System executes stop_loss first (highest priority)
#          → Uses market order (immediate fill)

exit_priorities:
  # CRITICAL PRIORITY (Level 1)
  # ===========================
  # WHY: These protect capital - cannot afford delay
  # EXECUTION: Market orders, immediate, no retries needed
  CRITICAL:
    - stop_loss              # Hard stop loss hit (-15% default)
    - circuit_breaker        # Daily loss limit exceeded ($500 default)

  # HIGH PRIORITY (Level 2)
  # =======================
  # WHY: These protect profits or manage significant risk
  # EXECUTION: Aggressive limit orders → walk 2x → market order
  HIGH:
    - trailing_stop          # Trailing stop activated and hit
    - time_based_urgent      # Market closing in <5 minutes
    - liquidity_dried_up     # Market became illiquid (spread >3¢ or volume <50)

  # MEDIUM PRIORITY (Level 3)
  # =========================
  # WHY: Profit-taking - want good price but not urgent
  # EXECUTION: Fair limit orders → walk up to 5x
  MEDIUM:
    - profit_target          # Target profit reached (+25% default)
    - partial_exit_target    # Partial exit threshold reached

  # LOW PRIORITY (Level 4)
  # ======================
  # WHY: Optimization - only exit if can get good price
  # EXECUTION: Conservative limit orders → walk up to 10x
  LOW:
    - early_exit             # Edge dropped below threshold (<2%)
    - edge_disappeared       # Edge turned negative
    - rebalance              # Better opportunity available

  # NOTE: edge_reversal REMOVED
  # WHY: Redundant with early_exit + edge_disappeared
  # All probability reversal scenarios covered by:
  # - stop_loss (if losing money)
  # - early_exit (if edge drops below 2%)
  # - edge_disappeared (if edge negative)

# ============================================
# EXIT EXECUTION STRATEGIES (Phase 5 Enhancement)
# ============================================
# CRITICAL CONCEPT: Urgency-based execution
# WHY: CRITICAL exits need immediate fills (use market orders)
#      LOW exits can wait for better prices (use conservative limits)
#
# EXECUTION FLOW:
# 1. Exit condition triggers
# 2. Check priority level
# 3. Choose execution strategy based on priority
# 4. Place order
# 5. If doesn't fill → escalate based on retry strategy
#
# EXAMPLE: stop_loss triggers (CRITICAL)
#          → Use market order
#          → Timeout 5s
#          → Retry: immediate_market (use market again if first fails)

exit_execution:
  # CRITICAL: Capital Protection
  # ============================
  # GOAL: Exit NOW, price is secondary
  CRITICAL:
    order_type: market                    # Market order (fills immediately)
    timeout_seconds: 5                    # Expect fill within 5s
    retry_strategy: immediate_market      # If fails, retry market order
    # EXAMPLE: Stop loss hit → Market sell → Fills at $0.48 (wanted $0.50)
    #          → Accept $0.02 slippage to protect capital

  # HIGH: Risk Management
  # =====================
  # GOAL: Exit quickly, try for decent price first
  HIGH:
    order_type: limit                     # Limit order first
    price_strategy: aggressive            # Cross spread slightly (fast fill)
    timeout_seconds: 10                   # Wait 10s for fill
    retry_strategy: walk_then_market      # Walk price 2x, then use market
    max_walks: 2                          # Maximum 2 price adjustments
    # EXAMPLE: Trailing stop hit → Limit at $0.75 → Doesn't fill in 10s
    #          → Walk to $0.74 → Wait 10s → Walk to $0.73 → Wait 10s
    #          → Still doesn't fill → Market order → Exit at $0.72

  # MEDIUM: Profit Taking
  # =====================
  # GOAL: Get fair price, willing to wait
  MEDIUM:
    order_type: limit                     # Limit order
    price_strategy: fair                  # Mid-spread (balanced)
    timeout_seconds: 30                   # Wait 30s for fill
    retry_strategy: walk_price            # Walk price up to max_walks
    max_walks: 5                          # Maximum 5 price adjustments
    # EXAMPLE: Profit target hit → Limit at $0.80 → Walk to $0.79, $0.78, etc.
    #          → Eventually fills or gives up after 5 walks

  # LOW: Optimization
  # =================
  # GOAL: Only exit if can get good price
  LOW:
    order_type: limit                     # Limit order
    price_strategy: conservative          # Best ask (best possible price)
    timeout_seconds: 60                   # Wait 60s for fill
    retry_strategy: walk_slowly           # Patient walking
    max_walks: 10                         # Maximum 10 price adjustments
    # EXAMPLE: Rebalancing opportunity → Limit at $0.85 → Very patient
    #          → Walk slowly over several minutes
    #          → If doesn't fill after 10 walks, position stays open

# ============================================
# LIQUIDITY CONSTRAINTS (Phase 5 Enhancement)
# ============================================
# CRITICAL CONCEPT: Illiquid markets are dangerous
# WHY: If market has wide spread (>3¢) or low volume (<50), we can't exit easily
#      This triggers high-priority exit to get out before liquidity disappears
#
# EXAMPLE: Enter position in liquid market (100 contracts, 1¢ spread)
#          → Later, volume drops to 30 contracts, spread widens to 4¢
#          → liquidity_dried_up triggers (HIGH priority)
#          → System exits aggressively before market completely freezes

liquidity:
  max_spread: "0.03"          # user-customizable: 3¢ maximum spread (triggers liquidity_dried_up)
  min_volume: 50            # user-customizable: 50 contracts minimum (triggers liquidity_dried_up)

  # WHY these thresholds?
  # - Spread >3¢ = ~3-6% round-trip cost (eats into edge)
  # - Volume <50 = might not be able to exit full position
  # - Both indicate deteriorating market conditions

# ============================================
# EXIT RULES (Original + Enhanced)
# ============================================
# When and how to close positions before settlement.

exit_rules:
  # MANDATORY EXITS (must close position)
  mandatory:
    # Exit if edge flips significantly negative
    # WHY: Wrong side of market now, get out!
    # Example: Entered at +8% edge, now at -5% edge
    negative_edge:
      enabled: true
      threshold: "-0.03"  # -3% edge (we're overpriced)

    # Exit if position health becomes critical
    # WHY: Multiple factors saying "this is bad"
    health_critical:
      enabled: true
      # Uses health_score.critical threshold above

    # Exit if correlation becomes too high
    # WHY: Position now correlated with others = concentrated risk
    correlation_breach:
      enabled: true
      max_correlation: "0.75"  # 75% correlation with portfolio

    # Exit if approaching settlement with loss
    # WHY: Don't wait for settlement if losing
    late_game_loss:
      enabled: true
      minutes_remaining: 10
      loss_threshold_pct: "0.20"  # Down 20% or more

  # OPTIONAL EXITS (discretionary, profit-taking)
  discretionary:
    # Take profit if hit target
    profit_target:
      enabled: true
      # Profit targets by strategy (some strategies hold longer)
      by_strategy:
        pre_game_entry:
          target_gain_pct: "0.50"  # Exit at 50% gain
        halftime_entry:
          target_gain_pct: "0.75"  # Exit at 75% gain
        live_trading:
          target_gain_pct: "0.40"  # Exit at 40% (faster churn)
        settlement_arbitrage:
          target_gain_pct: "1.00"  # Hold until 100% (near-certain)

    # Stop-loss if hit loss threshold
    stop_loss:
      enabled: true
      by_strategy:
        pre_game_entry:
          max_loss_pct: "0.40"  # Exit at 40% loss
        halftime_entry:
          max_loss_pct: "0.50"  # Exit at 50% loss
        live_trading:
          max_loss_pct: "0.30"  # Tighter stop (faster moving)
        settlement_arbitrage:
          max_loss_pct: "0.10"  # Very tight (should be low-risk)

    # Trailing stop (lock in gains as position appreciates)
    # WHY: Let winners run, but protect gains
    # CONCEPT: Stop loss that "trails" behind price as it rises
    #
    # EXAMPLE: Enter at $0.60, current price $0.75 (up 25%)
    #          → Trailing stop activates at 10% profit
    #          → Initial trail distance: 5%
    #          → Peak price: $0.75, stop price: $0.7125 (5% below peak)
    #          → Price rises to $0.80 → stop moves to $0.76
    #          → Price falls to $0.76 → STOP HIT → Exit with 27% gain
    #          → vs. no trailing stop → might ride back down to $0.60
    #
    # ADVANCED: Tightening trailing stop
    # WHY: As profit increases, protect more of it
    #      Initial 5% trail → tightens to 2% at higher profits
    trailing_stop:
      enabled: true
      activation_threshold: "0.10"  # user-customizable: Activate after 10% profit
      initial_distance: "0.05"      # user-customizable: Start with 5% trail distance
      tightening_rate: "0.01"       # user-customizable: Tighten 1% per 5% additional gain
      floor_distance: "0.02"        # user-customizable: Minimum 2% trail (never tighter)

      # TIGHTENING EXAMPLE:
      # Profit = 10% → Trail distance = 5% (initial)
      # Profit = 15% → Trail distance = 4% (5% - 1% = 4%)
      # Profit = 20% → Trail distance = 3% (5% - 2% = 3%)
      # Profit = 25% → Trail distance = 2% (5% - 3% = 2%, hits floor)
      # Profit = 50% → Trail distance = 2% (stays at floor)

      # NOTE: Trailing stop stored in database as JSONB
      # Schema: {
      #   "active": true,
      #   "activation_price": "0.66",
      #   "peak_price": "0.80",
      #   "current_stop_price": "0.784",
      #   "current_distance": "0.02"
      # }

    # PARTIAL EXITS (Phase 5 Enhancement)
    # ====================================
    # CRITICAL CONCEPT: Scale out of winners
    # WHY: Take some profit off table while letting rest run
    #      Reduces risk while maintaining upside exposure
    #
    # STRATEGY: 2-stage partial exits
    # Stage 1: Exit 50% at +15% profit (lock in gains)
    # Stage 2: Exit 25% at +25% profit (lock in more gains)
    # Remaining 25%: Ride with trailing stop (let it run!)
    #
    # EXAMPLE: Position of 100 contracts, entry $0.60
    #
    # Price $0.69 (+15%):
    #   → partial_exit_stage_1 triggers
    #   → Sell 50 contracts at $0.69
    #   → Realized P&L: 50 * ($0.69 - $0.60) = $4.50
    #   → 50 contracts remain
    #
    # Price $0.75 (+25%):
    #   → partial_exit_stage_2 triggers
    #   → Sell 25 contracts at $0.75
    #   → Realized P&L: 25 * ($0.75 - $0.60) = $3.75
    #   → 25 contracts remain
    #
    # Price rides to $0.90, then trailing stop hits at $0.88:
    #   → Sell remaining 25 at $0.88
    #   → Realized P&L: 25 * ($0.88 - $0.60) = $7.00
    #
    # TOTAL REALIZED: $4.50 + $3.75 + $7.00 = $15.25
    # vs. all-or-nothing: 100 * ($0.88 - $0.60) = $28.00 (IF trailing stop catches peak)
    #                      100 * ($0.60 - $0.60) = $0.00 (IF price reverses before exit)
    #
    # PSYCHOLOGY: Partial exits reduce "what if" regret
    # - If price tanks after stage 1: "At least I took some profit"
    # - If price moons after stage 2: "At least I left some to run"

    partial_exits:
      enabled: true  # user-customizable: Enable staged profit-taking

      stages:
        # STAGE 1: First profit target
        - name: "first_target"
          profit_threshold: "0.15"  # user-customizable: Exit when up 15%
          exit_percentage: 50     # user-customizable: Exit 50% of position
          # WHY 50%? Captures meaningful profit while keeping skin in game

        # STAGE 2: Second profit target
        - name: "second_target"
          profit_threshold: "0.25"  # user-customizable: Exit when up 25%
          exit_percentage: 25     # user-customizable: Exit 25% of remaining (25% of original)
          # WHY 25%? Further locks in gains, leaves 25% for moonshot
          # NOTE: This is 25% of REMAINING (50 contracts), not original
          #       So actually 25 contracts (25% of 100 original)

        # REMAINING 25%: Rides with trailing stop
        # No explicit stage needed - this is default behavior
        # Trailing stop protects these final contracts

      # EXECUTION: Partial exits use MEDIUM priority
      # WHY: We want good prices, but these are profit-taking (not urgent)

  # EXIT TIMING (when during game to exit)
  timing:
    # Avoid exiting during these game states
    # WHY: Volatility, spreads widen, hard to get good price

      - "challenge_pending"
      - "injury_stoppage"
      - "two_minute_warning"  # For NFL

# CORRELATION MANAGEMENT
# ============================================
# Prevent concentrated risk from correlated positions.
#
# EXAMPLE: These are highly correlated:
# - "Chiefs win" + "Chiefs cover spread"
# - "Over 50 points" + "Both teams score 24+"
# - "LeBron 30+ points" + "Lakers win"

correlation:
  # Calculate correlation between positions?
  # WHY: Essential for risk management
  enabled: true

  # How to calculate correlation?
  # Options:
  # - 'market': Same market category (conservative)
  # - 'game': Same game (stricter)
  # - 'team': Same team involved (strictest)
  # - 'statistical': Historical price correlation (most accurate)
  calculation_method: statistical

  # Correlation thresholds
  # WHY: High correlation = similar to having one large position
  levels:
    low: "0.30"       # 0-30% = independent
    medium: "0.60"    # 30-60% = somewhat related
    high: "0.80"      # 60-80% = highly related
    very_high: "0.90" # 80%+ = basically same bet

# ============================================
# REBALANCING
# ============================================
# Adjust position sizes as edge/probabilities change.
#
# EXAMPLE: Enter with $100 on Team A at 60% prob.
# Team A now 70% prob. Should increase position? Rebalancing decides.

rebalancing:
  enabled: false  # Start false, enable after comfortable

  # When to consider rebalancing?
  triggers:
    # Rebalance if edge increases significantly
    edge_increase:
      enabled: true
      threshold: "0.05"  # Edge increased by 5%

    # Rebalance if probability changes significantly
    probability_change:
      enabled: true
      threshold: "0.10"  # Probability changed by 10%

    # Rebalance at specific times
    scheduled:
      enabled: false
      times:
        - "halftime"
        - "third_quarter_end"

  # How to rebalance?
  method:
    # Options:
    # - 'full_kelly': Recalculate optimal Kelly size
    # - 'incremental': Small adjustments only
    # - 'hedge': Add opposite position if edge flipped
    type: incremental

    # For incremental: How much to adjust?
    incremental:
      max_adjustment_pct: "0.25"  # Max 25% size change
      min_edge_for_increase: "0.08"  # Need 8% edge to add

  # Costs
  # WHY: Rebalancing costs transaction fees
  consider_transaction_costs: true
  min_edge_improvement: "0.03"  # Need 3% better edge to justify cost

# ============================================
# SETTLEMENT MANAGEMENT
# ============================================
# Handling positions as they approach settlement.

settlement:
  # Auto-exit before settlement?
  # WHY: Sometimes better to exit early and redeploy capital
  # vs waiting for settlement (which can take hours/days)
  auto_exit_before_settlement:
    enabled: false  # Usually want to hold until settlement
    minutes_before_settlement: 60  # Exit 1 hour early if enabled
    min_unrealized_gain_pct: "0.80"  # Only if up 80%+

  # Settlement verification
  # WHY: Verify we got paid correctly
  verify_settlements: true

  # Settlement disputes
  # WHY: Sometimes markets settle incorrectly (rare but happens)
  dispute_incorrect_settlements:
    enabled: true
    auto_dispute: false  # Manual review before disputing
    log_for_review: true

# ============================================
# POSITION SIZING ADJUSTMENTS
# ============================================
# Modify Kelly sizing based on position characteristics.
#
# WHY: Not all edges are equal. Adjust sizing for risk factors.

sizing_adjustments:
  # Reduce size for volatile markets
  # WHY: High volatility = higher risk, even with same edge
  volatility_adjustment:
    enabled: true
    # If volatility is 2x normal, reduce size by 30%
    high_volatility_threshold: "2.0"
    size_reduction_pct: "0.30"

  # Reduce size for illiquid markets
  # WHY: Hard to exit if needed
  liquidity_adjustment:
    enabled: true
    # If volume < min threshold, reduce size
    low_volume_threshold: 50  # contracts
    size_reduction_pct: "0.50"  # 50% reduction

  # Reduce size for wide spreads
  # WHY: High transaction cost effectively reduces edge
  spread_adjustment:
    enabled: true
    wide_spread_threshold: "0.04"  # 4% spread
    size_reduction_pct: "0.25"  # 25% reduction

  # Adjust size based on time to settlement
  # WHY: More time = more uncertainty
  time_adjustment:
    enabled: true
    # Reduce size if > 3 hours to settlement
    long_duration_hours: "3.0"
    size_reduction_pct: "0.20"

  # Adjust size based on model confidence
  # WHY: If model is less confident, bet less
  confidence_adjustment:
    enabled: true
    # If confidence < threshold, reduce size
    low_confidence_threshold: "0.70"  # 70%
    size_reduction_pct: "0.40"

# ============================================
# PORTFOLIO OPTIMIZATION
# ============================================
# Advanced: Optimize portfolio for best risk/return.
#
# WHY: Sometimes it's better to close a winning position
# to make room for an even better opportunity.

optimization:
  enabled: false  # Phase 6+, advanced feature

  # Reallocation triggers
  # Close existing position to fund new one?
  reallocate_capital:
    enabled: false
    # Only if new opportunity is significantly better
    min_edge_improvement: "0.10"  # 10% better edge
    # And existing position is near profit target
    existing_position_min_gain: "0.40"  # Up 40%+

# ============================================
# RISK METRICS
# ============================================
# Track and report portfolio risk metrics.

    - "total_exposure"
    - "exposure_by_sport"
    - "exposure_by_strategy"

  # How often to recalculate?
  calculation_frequency: "hourly"

  # Alert thresholds

    # Alert if VaR exceeds threshold
    var_threshold: "0.10"  # 10% of portfolio

    # Alert if correlation too high
    correlation_threshold: "0.75"

    # Alert if max drawdown increasing
    max_drawdown_threshold: "0.15"  # 15%

# ============================================
# POSITION LIFECYCLE TRACKING
# ============================================
# Track position from entry to exit for analysis.

lifecycle_tracking:
  enabled: true

  # What to log at each stage?
  log_events:
    - "position_opened"
    - "position_size_adjusted"

  # Performance attribution
  # WHY: Understand why position won/lost
  attribution:
    enabled: true
    factors:
      - "edge_accuracy"  # Was predicted edge accurate?
      - "timing"  # Did we enter/exit at right time?

      - "external"  # Random events (injuries, weather, etc.)

# ============================================
# NOTES FOR POSITION MANAGEMENT
# ============================================
# Position management is where most traders fail. They focus
# on finding good entries but don't manage positions actively.
#
# KEY PRINCIPLES:
#
# 1. SET IT AND FORGET IT (mostly)
#    - Don't over-manage
#    - Let winners run
#    - Trust your stop-losses
#
# 2. CUT LOSERS QUICKLY
#    - If edge flips, exit
#    - Don't hope it comes back
#    - Live to trade another day
#
# 3. DIVERSIFY
#    - Don't load up on correlated positions
#    - Spread risk across sports, strategies
#
# 4. TRACK EVERYTHING
#    - Learn from wins AND losses
#    - Adjust rules based on data
#
# 5. AUTOMATE
#    - Emotions are the enemy
#    - Let the system handle exits
#    - Only manual override in emergencies
#
# BEGINNER SETTINGS:
# - Start with mandatory exits only
# - Use wide stop-losses (50%)
# - Don't rebalance yet
# - Focus on entries first
#
# INTERMEDIATE SETTINGS:
# - Add profit targets
# - Add trailing stops
# - Start tracking correlation
# - Consider discretionary exits
#
# ADVANCED SETTINGS:
# - Enable rebalancing
# - Optimize portfolio
# - Use all sizing adjustments
# - Track all risk metrics

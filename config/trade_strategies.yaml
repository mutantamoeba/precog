# trade_strategies.yaml - Strategy-Specific Parameters
# ============================================
# This file defines WHEN and HOW to trade based on different strategies.
# Each strategy has different risk/reward profiles and works best in
# different market conditions.
#
# Think of these as different "trading playbooks" - you use different
# plays depending on the situation.
#
# Version: "2.0" (Phase 0.5 - Added Versioning Support)
# Last Updated: 2025-10-21
# ============================================

# ============================================
# STRATEGY VERSIONING & LIFECYCLE (Phase 0.5)
# ============================================
# CRITICAL CONCEPT: Immutable strategy versions for performance tracking
# WHY: Cannot evaluate strategy improvements if strategy keeps changing!
#      Immutable versions allow rigorous backtesting and attribution
#
# VERSIONING PHILOSOPHY:
# - Each strategy configuration gets unique version (e.g., "live_continuous_v1.0")
# - Once deployed, version is IMMUTABLE (never changes)
# - To modify: create NEW version (e.g., "live_continuous_v1.1")
# - Old versions stay in database for historical analysis
#
# SEMANTIC VERSIONING:
# - v1.0 → v1.1: Minor update (parameter adjustment)
#   Example: Change required_confidence from 0.08 to 0.10
# - v1.0 → v2.0: Major update (significant logic change)
#   Example: Change from pre-game to live-only strategy
#
# LIFECYCLE STATES:
# 1. DRAFT: Being developed, not deployed
# 2. TESTING: In paper trading or limited deployment
# 3. ACTIVE: Fully deployed, generating real trades
# 4. DEPRECATED: Replaced by newer version, kept for records
#
# EXAMPLE LIFECYCLE:
# pre_game_nfl_v1.0 (ACTIVE)   → Deployed, making trades
#     ↓ (found required_confidence too low, too many losses)
# pre_game_nfl_v1.1 (TESTING)  → Testing with required_confidence 0.10
#     ↓ (v1.1 performs 5% better over 60 days)
# pre_game_nfl_v1.0 (DEPRECATED) + pre_game_nfl_v1.1 (ACTIVE)
#
# DATABASE SCHEMA (strategies table):
# - strategy_id: Primary key
# - strategy_name: "pre_game_entry"
# - strategy_version: "v1.0"
# - sport: "nfl" | "nba" | "mlb" | NULL (multi-sport)
# - status: "draft" | "testing" | "active" | "deprecated"
# - config: JSONB (full configuration from this file)
# - created_at: Timestamp
#
# USAGE IN TRADING:
# - Each trade records strategy_id used
# - Enables attribution: Which strategy generated profitable trades?
# - Enables A/B testing: Compare v1.0 vs v1.1 performance side-by-side
#
# EXAMPLE TRADE RECORD:
# - trade_id: 12345
# - strategy_id: 42 (pre_game_nfl_v1.1)
# - model_id: 17 (elo_nfl_v2.0)
# - method_id: 8 (combines strategy + model + position mgmt)
# → Full attribution chain!

versioning:

  # WHY: Required for Phase 5+ when multiple strategies compete
  enabled: true

  # Version naming convention
  # Format: {strategy_type}_{sport}_{version}
  # Examples:
  #   - pre_game_nfl_v1.0
  #   - live_continuous_nba_v2.3
  #   - halftime_mlb_v1.0
  #   - settlement_arb_v1.0 (multi-sport, no sport suffix)

    min_testing_days: 60  # Minimum 60 days in TESTING (longer than models)
    min_testing_trades: 50  # Minimum 50 trades

    # Auto-deprecate old versions?
    # WHY: Once v1.1 is ACTIVE, v1.0 should be DEPRECATED
    auto_deprecate_on_replacement: true

    # Keep deprecated versions in database?
    # WHY: Historical analysis and audit trail
    retain_deprecated: true
    retention_years: 5  # Keep for 5 years

  # A/B Testing configuration
  # WHY: Run multiple strategy versions side-by-side to compare
  ab_testing:

    # How to split traffic between versions?
    # Example: v1.0 (70%) vs v1.1 (30%)
    # WHY: Strategies affect capital allocation, more conservative split
    default_traffic_split:
      existing_version: "0.70"  # 70% of capital
      new_version: "0.30"       # 30% of capital

    # Evaluation criteria for promotion
    # WHY: Need objective criteria to promote v1.1 → ACTIVE
    promotion_criteria:
      min_improvement_pct: "0.05"  # 5% better Sharpe ratio
      min_evaluation_period_days: 60
      confidence_level: "0.95"  # 95% statistical significance
      min_trade_count: 50  # Need enough trades for significance

    # Performance metrics for comparison
    # WHY: Multiple dimensions matter, not just profit
    comparison_metrics:
      - "sharpe_ratio"        # Risk-adjusted return
      - "win_rate"            # % of profitable trades
      - "avg_profit_per_trade"  # Average trade profit
      - "max_drawdown"        # Worst losing streak
      - "edge_accuracy"       # Predicted vs actual edges

# ============================================
# STRATEGY PRIORITY
# ============================================
# Which strategies are enabled and in what order?
# WHY: If multiple strategies find edges in the same market,
# use this priority to decide which one to execute.

  2: live_trading
  3: pre_game_entry
  4: settlement_arbitrage
  # Lower number = higher priority

# ============================================
# PRE-GAME ENTRY STRATEGY
# ============================================
# Trade BEFORE the game starts based on model predictions.
#
# PROS:
# - More time to analyze
# - Less emotional/reactive
# - Can use historical data better
#
# CONS:
# - No live game information
# - Lineup changes can invalidate edge
# - Weather changes can invalidate edge
#
# WHEN TO USE: When your model has strong historical edges
# and game conditions are stable (weather forecast, lineups confirmed)

pre_game_entry:
  enabled: true

  # How early before game start can we trade?
  # WHY: Too early = risk lineup changes, weather changes
  #      Too late = market might have moved, edge gone

# ============================================
# HALFTIME ENTRY STRATEGY
# ============================================
# Trade AT HALFTIME based on first half performance.
#
# PROS:
# - Have actual game data (not just predictions)
# - Can see team momentum, strategy adjustments
# - Markets often mispriced due to recency bias
#
# CONS:
# - Less time to decide (halftime is ~15 min)
# - Must process data quickly
# - Second half can be very different from first half
#
# WHEN TO USE: This is the SWEET SPOT strategy. Markets
# overreact to first half, creating edges.
#
# EXAMPLE: Team down 7-3 at halftime but outgaining opponent
# 250 yards to 150 yards. Market overweights score, underweights
# dominance. Edge opportunity.

      # Which second-half markets to trade?
      allowed_markets:
        - "second_half_winner"   # Who wins 2nd half only
        - "second_half_total"    # 2nd half over/under
        - "game_winner"          # Still can trade game winner
        - "will_score_next"      # Next team to score

      # Key factors to analyze at halftime
      # These affect whether we trust the edge

        # differently (more aggressive, risk-taking)
        blowout_threshold: 17    # 17+ point deficit = blowout
        close_game_threshold: 7  # 7 or less = close game

# ============================================
# LIVE TRADING STRATEGY
# ============================================
# Trade DURING the game based on real-time events.
#
# PROS:
# - Most current information
# - Can react to game flow
# - Catch market overreactions
#
# CONS:
# - Very fast-paced (must decide quickly)
# - Higher variance (momentum can shift instantly)
# - Requires real-time data (expensive, complex)
#
# WHEN TO USE: When you have reliable real-time data and
# the market is clearly mispricing based on recent events.
#
# EXAMPLE: Star QB throws interception. Market overreacts,
# drops team's win probability too much. Edge opportunity
# if team still has strong defense and time remaining.

live_trading:
  enabled: false  # Start with false, enable in Phase 3

  # How quickly must we react?
  # WHY: In live trading, edges disappear fast as market adjusts
  max_decision_time_seconds: 10

  # Minimum edge required (higher than pre-game)
  # WHY: Live trading is riskier, need bigger edge to compensate
  min_edge_live: "0.10"  # 10% minimum

  sports_config:

# ============================================
# SETTLEMENT ARBITRAGE STRATEGY
# ============================================
# Trade near end of game when outcome is virtually certain
# but market hasn't fully adjusted.
#
# PROS:
# - Very high win rate (>95%)
# - Low risk (outcome almost certain)
# - Quick turnover (settled within hours)
#
# CONS:
# - Small edges (2-5%)
# - Rare opportunities (only when market is slow)
# - Requires fast execution
#
# WHEN TO USE: When game outcome is 99% certain but
# market is still pricing in some uncertainty.
#
# EXAMPLE: Team up 35-3 with 2 minutes left. Win probability
# is 99.9% but market still pricing at 98%. Free 1.9% edge.

  # Edge requirements
  # WHY: Edges are small but wins are nearly certain
  min_edge: "0.02"  # 2% minimum (lower than other strategies)

  # Position sizing override
  # WHY: These are nearly risk-free, so can size bigger
  kelly_fraction_override: "0.50"  # Half Kelly (vs 0.25 default)

# ============================================
# HEDGE STRATEGY (RISK REDUCTION)
# ============================================
# Place opposite bets to lock in profits or limit losses.
#
# EXAMPLE: Bet $100 on Team A at 60% for $167 potential return.
# Team A now 80% likely (40% market price). Place $50 hedge bet
# on Team B at 20% for $250 potential return.
#
# OUTCOMES:
# - Team A wins: $167 - $100 - $50 = +$17 profit (locked in)
# - Team B wins: $250 - $100 - $50 = +$100 profit (bonus)
#
# WHEN TO USE: When position has moved in your favor significantly
# and you want to lock in guaranteed profit.

hedge_strategy:
  enabled: true

  # When to consider hedging?

    # Example: $100 bet now worth $150 → 50% gain
    min_unrealized_gain_pct: "0.40"  # 40% unrealized gain

    # Hedge if edge has flipped this much
    # Example: Entered at 8% edge, now -5% edge (13% flip)

  # - 'partial_lock': Reduce risk but keep some upside
  # - 'kelly_optimal': Use Kelly to determine hedge size

# ============================================
# STRATEGY COMBINATIONS
# ============================================
# Can we use multiple strategies on the same game?
# WHY: Sometimes pre-game bet looks good, then halftime
# creates a new opportunity. Should we take both?

  #
  # RECOMMENDATION: priority (lets you control behavior)

# ============================================
# NOTES FOR STRATEGY SELECTION
# ============================================
# Which strategy should you start with?
#
# BEGINNER PATH:
# 1. Week 1-2: settlement_arbitrage only
#    - Easiest to understand
#    - Lowest risk
#    - Build confidence
#
# 2. Week 3-4: Add pre_game_entry
#    - More opportunities
#    - Still relatively simple
#    - Uses historical data
#
# 3. Week 5-6: Add halftime_entry
#    - THE MONEY MAKER
#    - More complex but highest ROI
#    - Requires faster decision making
#
# 4. Week 7+: Consider live_trading
#    - Most complex
#    - Requires real-time data infrastructure
#    - Highest potential but highest variance
#
# STRATEGY EFFECTIVENESS (rough estimates):
# - Pre-game: 3-6% ROI, 52-55% win rate
# - Halftime: 8-12% ROI, 55-60% win rate ⭐ BEST
# - Live: 10-15% ROI, 60-65% win rate (but harder to execute)
# - Settlement: 2-4% ROI, 95%+ win rate (but rare opportunities)
#
# Remember: Start with ONE strategy, master it, then add more!

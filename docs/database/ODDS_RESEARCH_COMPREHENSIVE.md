# Comprehensive Sports Win Probability Data & Research

**Version:** 2.0 (Comprehensive Merge)  
**Last Updated:** October 7, 2025  
**Research Scope:** NFL, NBA, Tennis  
**Data Sources:** 40+ validated datasets covering 1980-2025

---

## Executive Summary

**Win probabilities in sports betting are surprisingly precise and well-documented, with NFL halftime leads of 10+ points yielding 89.5% win rates, NBA home teams overcoming 3-point halftime deficits 50% of the time, and tennis players leading 2-0 in Grand Slams winning 82-85% of matches.** [docsports +2](https://www.docsports.com/2008/halftime-leaders-114.html) These benchmarks, drawn from datasets spanning decades and tens of thousands of games, provide robust validation points for odds matrices.

**Key Findings:**
- NFL teams leading 10+ at halftime: **89.5% win rate** (n=1,250 games)
- NBA 10-point halftime leads: **~80% win rate** (home/road split 76-87%)
- Tennis 2-0 set leads (best-of-5): **82-85% win rate** (n=1,216 matches)
- Home advantage has declined **20% across all sports** since 2020

**Critical Gaps Identified:**
- Granular NFL halftime margins (4-6, 7-9 point ranges lack direct data)
- Tennis surface-dependent variations undervalued by markets
- Post-2020 home advantage still stabilizing

## NFL Win Probabilities

### Overall Halftime Statistics

The most comprehensive NFL win probability data comes from analysis of games since 1980, with particularly detailed research from The Commute Sports (2009-2020) and Boyd's Bets historical databases. [docsports](https://www.docsports.com/2008/halftime-leaders-114.html)

**Core Finding:**
- **Teams leading at halftime win 77.4% of games** across all margins
- Remarkably stable since 1998 (variation only 74.7% - 79%)
- Based on 25+ years and thousands of games

### Specific Halftime Deficits

| Deficit | Win Probability | Games Analyzed | Source |
|---------|-----------------|----------------|--------|
| **17+ points** | 6.38% | 486 (31 comebacks) | The Commute Sports 2009-2020 |
| **10+ points** | 10.48% | 1,250 (131 comebacks) | The Commute Sports 2009-2020 |
| **7+ points** | ~18-22% | Estimated from spread data | Multiple sources |
| **3+ points** | ~40-44% | Point spread correlation | Boyd's Bets |

**Inverse (Leading at Halftime):**
- **Leading 10+: 89.5%** win rate
- **Leading 7+: 78-82%** win rate (estimated)
- **Leading 3+: 56-60%** win rate

[thecommutesports](https://thecommutesports.com/2020/09/02/nfl-comeback-analysis/)

### Point Spread Win Probabilities

Most precise data from all NFL games since 1980:

| Spread | Win % | Confidence | Based On |
|--------|-------|------------|----------|
| **3-point favorite** | 59.4% | Very High | Decades of games |
| **7-point favorite** | 75.2% | Very High | Decades of games |
| **10-point favorite** | 83.6% | Very High | Decades of games |
| **14-point favorite** | 92.4% | Very High | Decades of games |

These represent the most reliable benchmarks available for NFL betting.

### Late-Game Situations

**Fourth Quarter with 14-Point Lead:**
- Historical record: **195-0** (before Cowboys' 2023 loss to Packers)
- Win probability: **~93%+**
- Note: This milestone was broken in 2023

[NBC Sports](https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/before-sunday-dallas-was-195-0-when-entering-fourth-quarter-with-14-point-lead)

**Fourth Quarter Behavior:**
- Trailing teams: **~90% passing on first down**
- Leading teams: **~90% running on first down**
- Dramatic strategy shifts based on score differential

[NFL Football Operations](https://operations.nfl.com/gameday/analytics/stats-articles/)

### Critical Data Gaps

**Missing Granular Breakdowns:**

While overall halftime lead data is robust, specific win percentages for teams leading by exactly **4-6 points** or **7-9 points** at halftime lack comprehensive historical datasets with documented sample sizes.

**Available Estimates** (derived from deficit data and spread correlations):
- 4-6 point leads: **68-72%** (interpolated)
- 7-9 point leads: **75-80%** (interpolated)

This represents the primary gap for NFL odds matrix validation.

## NBA Win Probabilities

### Comprehensive Quarter-by-Quarter Data

Professor MJ's analysis of **14 complete seasons (2002-2016)** provides exact win-loss records for every point margin at each quarter, covering tens of thousands of games with home/road splits. [professormj +3](https://www.professormj.com/pages/comeback-probabilities)

### Halftime Lead Data

| Lead (Points) | Home Win % | Road Win % | Overall |
|---------------|------------|------------|---------|
| **1 point** | 56.9% | 42.7% | ~50% |
| **2 points** | 53.8% | 37.8% | ~46% |
| **3 points** | 50.2% | 35.2% | ~43% |
| **10 points** | 76.3% | 86.6% | ~80% |
| **10-13 points** | 76-94% | Variable | 76-94% |
| **14+ points** | 85.3%+ | 90.5%+ | 85-95% |

**Key Finding:** Home teams trailing by 1-3 points at halftime still have >50% win probability, while road teams in the same situation have only 35-43%. This **15-20 percentage point home court advantage** in comeback probability is far larger than most models account for.

[Professormj](https://www.professormj.com/pages/interesting-nba-comeback-probabilities) [professormj](https://www.professormj.com/pages/comeback-probabilities)

### Quarter-by-Quarter Progression

**After First Quarter:**
- Home teams trailing 1 point: **60% win rate** (391-296 record)
- Even stronger home advantage than at halftime

**After Third Quarter:**
- Home teams down 1 point: **49.6% win rate** (278-282 record)
- Nearly a coin flip, advantage has dissipated

This shows how dramatically win probabilities tighten as games progress.

[professormj](https://www.professormj.com/pages/interesting-nba-comeback-probabilities) [Professormj](https://www.professormj.com/pages/comeback-probabilities)

### Large Deficit Comebacks

**20-Point Deficits:**
- After Q3: Only **1 road team** in 14 seasons completed comeback
  - Seattle over Utah, 106-103 (April 7, 2007, trailed 87-67)
- In first half (1997-2021): **7% comeback rate** (276 of 3,942 games)
- Earlier deficits more likely to be overcome

[professormj +2](https://www.professormj.com/pages/comeback-probabilities) [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667239124000285)

### Home Court Advantage

**Historical vs. Modern:**
- Historical (2000-2013): **60% home win rate**
- COVID season (2020-21): **54%** (historic low)
- 2022-23: **58%** (recovery)
- 2023-24: **~54%** (declined again)

**Conference Differences:**
- Western Conference: **64.5%** home advantage
- Eastern Conference: **58.5%** home advantage

[MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/14/21/9989)

**Playoff Home Advantage:**
- Overall playoffs (2013-2021): **60.67%** (509-330 across 839 games)
- **NBA Finals only: 54.39%** (lowest of any playoff round)

[SportsHandle](https://sportshandle.com/court-advantage-nba-playoffs/)

### Controversial "Trailing at Halftime" Study

The Berger & Pope study (18,000 games, 1993-2009) found teams behind by 1 point at halftime won **5.8% more often than expected**. [Statistical Modeling](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2022/02/06/thinking-bayesianly-about-the-being-behind-at-halftime-effect-in-basketball/)

**Critical caveat:** This effect **did NOT replicate** in any other time period or in NCAA/WNBA games. Modern bettors should ignore this finding.

## Tennis Win Probabilities

### Grand Slam Set Lead Data

Comprehensive dataset: **17,269 Grand Slam matches (1990-2024)**

**Players Leading 2-0:**
- Overall win probability: **82-85%**
- Comeback players forcing 2-2: **Win 55.35% of deciding sets** (1,216 matches)
- Overall comeback success: **15-18%** (when down 2-0)

[medium](https://medium.com/@yaskalidis/a-deep-dive-into-2-0-down-comebacks-in-tennis-97de01e7d3ec)

### Surface-Specific Variations

**Deciding Set Win Rates (After 2-2):**
- **Australian Open (hard)**: 57%+ comeback player advantage
- **French Open (clay)**: 57%+ comeback player advantage  
- **Wimbledon (grass)**: **50%** (NO momentum advantage)
- **US Open (hard)**: Similar to Australian Open

**Critical Finding:** Wimbledon shows **0% comeback momentum advantage** (50-50 in deciding sets), suggesting grass court serving dominance neutralizes psychological factors.

[Medium](https://medium.com/@yaskalidis/a-deep-dive-into-2-0-down-comebacks-in-tennis-97de01e7d3ec)

### Round-Specific Patterns

**Deciding Set Win Rates (Comeback Player):**
- **Finals**: 60% (highest advantage)
- **Semifinals**: 43.8% (only round with disadvantage)
- Other rounds: 50-57%

This **16-point swing** between adjacent rounds indicates complex interaction between match importance and momentum.

[Medium](https://medium.com/@yaskalidis/a-deep-dive-into-2-0-down-comebacks-in-tennis-97de01e7d3ec) [medium](https://medium.com/@yaskalidis/a-deep-dive-into-2-0-down-comebacks-in-tennis-97de01e7d3ec)

### Best-of-Three Matches

**Winning First Set:**
- Match win probability: **83.8%**
- Based on **40,483 ATP matches since 2011**
- Exceeds theoretical 75% baseline for evenly-matched players
- Confirms momentum and confidence effects

**Match Patterns:**
- Straight sets: **69.6%** of matches
- LWW (lose first, win match): **16.2%** of winners

[Tennis Abstract](https://www.tennisabstract.com/blog/2014/08/13/a-quick-look-at-the-odds-of-three-setters/)

### Service Advantage by Surface

**Grand Slam Service Point Win % (Men):**
- **Wimbledon (grass)**: 66%
- **US Open (hard)**: 64%
- **Australian Open (hard)**: 63%
- **French Open (clay)**: 61%

**Women:** Run ~2 percentage points lower at each event.

**Impact:** This **5-point spread** between grass and clay fundamentally changes match dynamics and comeback probabilities. Betting markets often undervalue these surface effects.

[Tennis Abstract](https://www.tennisabstract.com/blog/2011/09/16/win-probability-graphs-and-stats/)

### Break Point Performance

**Average Break Point Impact:**
- Changes match win probability by **7.5%**
- Roughly **13 break points = 1 match win** in expected value

**Clutch Performance Myth:**
- Break point conversion shows **zero year-to-year correlation** (r² = 0.002)
- Players who significantly outperform in one season **completely regress to mean** next season
- "Clutch" performance on break points is **largely random variance**

[Tennis Abstract](http://www.tennisabstract.com/blog/category/win-probability/) [tennisabstract](https://www.tennisabstract.com/blog/2019/01/04/measuring-the-impact-of-break-points/)

### Serving for the Set

**Pressure Effects:**
- ATP players: **0.7% less often** hold serve (1 break per 143 attempts)
- WTA players: **3.4% decline** (1 break per 30 attempts)

**Outliers:**
- Andy Murray: **6% MORE** often holds when serving for set
- Maria Sharapova: **3% MORE** often holds

Pressure effects are smaller than conventional wisdom suggests.

[tennisabstract](https://www.tennisabstract.com/blog/2015/09/28/the-odds-of-successfully-serving-out-the-set/)

### Tiebreak Performance

**Genuine Skill Differences:**

Unlike break points, tiebreak performance shows consistent skill advantages:

| Player | Career Win % | Record |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| **Novak Djokovic** | 65-66% | 307-162 all-time, 14-4 in 2023 |
| **Roger Federer** | 65.4% | 466-247 |
| **Pete Sampras** | 62.8% | 328-194 |
| **John McEnroe** | 72.2% | Limited modern data |

Average tournament player: **51%**

These rates significantly exceed random distribution, suggesting tiebreak-specific skills.

[Bruins Sports Analytics](https://www.bruinsportsanalytics.com/post/tiebreaker)

### Mathematical Amplification

**Point → Match Probability:**
- **55% point win** → 60% games → 84% sets
- **60% point win** → 74% games → 90% sets

Small edges in point-winning ability create **exponential advantages** in match probability.

## Advanced NFL Metrics

### Four Dominant Metrics

Four advanced metrics dominate modern NFL analytics, each with distinct purposes and accessibility levels. [Wikipedia +2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Football_Analytics)

### 1. DVOA (Defense-adjusted Value Over Average)

**Creator:** Aaron Schatz (2003)  
**Availability:** ftnfantasy.com (1978-present, after Football Outsiders shutdown 2023)

**Methodology:**
- Measures every play's success vs. league-average baseline
- Adjusted for: down, distance, field position, opponent strength, game situation
- Success thresholds: 45% (1st down), 60% (2nd down), 100% (3rd/4th down)
- Bonuses: +3 points (10+ yards), +5 points (40+ yards)
- Penalties: Turnovers

**Scale:**
- 0% = League average
- Elite offenses: **+25-30% DVOA** (2022 KC: +25.2%)
- Elite defenses: **-15% to -25%** (2022 SF: -14.1%)

**Key Limitation:** Individual player DVOA heavily team-dependent (scheme, O-line, QB play-action).

### 2. EPA (Expected Points Added)

**Origins:** Carter & Machol (1970), modernized by Carnegie Mellon & Ben Baldwin's nflfastR  
**Availability:** **FREE** via nflfastR R package (1999-present), rbsdm.com dashboards (no coding required)

**Methodology:**
- Quantifies each play's value by point expectation changes
- Based on field position, down, distance, time
- Expected point values: Own 20 = +0.4 EP, Opponent 20 = +4.0 EP, Midfield = +2.0 EP

**Scale:**
- Elite offenses: **+0.15 to +0.25 EPA per play**
- Elite defenses: **-0.10 to -0.15 EPA per play** (negative is better)

**Example:**
- 15-yard completion from own 25 to own 40: **0.82 EPA** (1.88 - 1.06)

[theScore +2](https://www.thescore.com/nfl/news/2193857) [The Lines](https://www.thelines.com/betting/nfl/epa/)

**Advantages:**
- Full transparency
- Free access
- Preferred for custom analysis

**Limitations:**
- No opponent adjustment in raw form [The Lines](https://www.thelines.com/betting/nfl/epa/)
- Vulnerable to turnover luck (fumble recovery locations largely random)
- Team dependency makes isolating individual contributions difficult

[theScore](https://www.thescore.com/nfl/news/2193857)

### 3. SP+ (Success Rate Plus)

**Creator:** Bill Connelly  
**Sport:** **COLLEGE FOOTBALL ONLY** (NOT NFL)  
**Availability:** ESPN.com (weekly updates)

**Methodology:**
- Combines success rate efficiency with explosiveness
- Adjusted for opponent strength and tempo
- Incorporates preseason projections (returning production, recruiting, coaching)

**Scale:**
- Points above/below average FBS team
- Elite programs: **+30 to +40 SP+**

**Key Limitation:** Predictive rather than résumé-based (doesn't automatically reward tough schedules or quality wins).

### 4. FPI (Football Power Index)

**Creator:** ESPN (proprietary)  
**Availability:** ESPN.com (daily updates)

**Methodology:**
- Points above/below average on neutral field
- Combines: Offensive EPA, Defensive EPA, Special Teams
- NFL adjustments: QB play (Predictive QBR), rest, travel, altitude, weather

**Scale:**
- Elite NFL teams: **+6 to +10 FPI**
- Poor teams: **-6 to -10 FPI**
- College FPI: -20 to +30 (wider due to talent disparities)

**Features:**
- 10,000-20,000 simulations for season projections
- Bayesian priors influence ratings throughout season

**Key Limitation:** **Proprietary methodology not fully disclosed** (cannot verify independently). Slower adjustment to in-season changes compared to pure EPA models.

**Reported Accuracy:** 73% favorite win rate (2016), better than Vegas closing lines.

[Open Source Football](https://opensourcefootball.com/posts/2020-09-28-nflfastr-ep-wp-and-cp-models/)

### Recommended Usage

For practical application:

1. **Primary:** **EPA via nflfastR/rbsdm.com** (best balance of power and accessibility)
2. **Validation:** DVOA (superior situational breakdowns, historical comparisons)
3. **Baseline:** FPI (useful for game predictions, but cross-reference with transparent metrics)
4. **Ignore for NFL:** SP+ (college only)

---

## Home Advantage Decline

### NFL Home Advantage

**Historical vs. Modern:**
- Traditional: **2.5-3 points** on spread
- Current: **1.5 points**
- Home win rates: **57-60%** (historical) → **52-53%** (2020+)

**Largest Single-Season Drop:**
- 2006: **3.30 points**
- 2020 (COVID): **1.30 points** in parts of season

**Post-Pandemic:** Decline continued, suggesting **permanent structural changes** rather than temporary COVID effects.

[NFL Football Operations](https://operations.nfl.com/gameday/analytics/stats-articles/) [Covers +2](https://www.covers.com/nfl/home-field-advantage)

**Contributing Factors:**
1. Reduced crowd noise influence
2. Improved instant replay (reducing referee bias)
3. Better travel accommodations
4. Evolving offensive strategies that travel well

[Covers](https://www.covers.com/nfl/home-field-advantage) [Chicago Booth Review](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/review/home-field-advantage-facts-and-fiction)

### NBA Home Advantage

**Historical vs. Modern:**
- Historical: **60% home win rate** (2000-2013)
- Recent: **54-58%** (variable)
- COVID season (2020-21): **54%** (historic low)
- 2022-23: **58%** (recovery)
- 2023-24: **~54%** (declined again)

[MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/14/21/9989) [Yahoo Sports](https://sports.yahoo.com/fact-or-fiction-is-home-court-advantage-in-the-nbas-regular-season-dead-194958543.html)

**Impact on Odds Matrices:**
- Matrices using pre-2020 values **systematically overvalue home teams**
- Adjustment needed: **~1 point in NFL spreads**, **3-5 percentage points in NBA win probability**

## Odds Matrix Validation

### High-Confidence Benchmarks

Based on large sample sizes with confidence intervals:

| Sport | Situation | Win % | Sample Size | Confidence |
|-------|-----------|-------|-------------|------------|
| **NFL** | 10+ lead at half | 89.5% ± 2% | n=1,250 | Very High |
| **NFL** | 3-pt favorite | 59.4% ± 1-2% | Decades | Very High |
| **NFL** | 7-pt favorite | 75.2% ± 1-2% | Decades | Very High |
| **NFL** | 10-pt favorite | 83.6% ± 1-2% | Decades | Very High |
| **NFL** | 14-pt favorite | 92.4% ± 1-2% | Decades | Very High |
| **NBA** | 10-pt lead at half | 76-87% | Thousands | High |
| **NBA** | Home trailing 3 at half | 50.2% | 14 seasons | High |
| **Tennis** | 2-0 lead (Bo5) | 82-85% ± 3% | n=1,216 | High |
| **Tennis** | Won 1st set (Bo3) | 83.8% ± 1% | n=40,483 | Very High |

[docsports +4](https://www.docsports.com/2008/halftime-leaders-114.html) [Professormj](https://www.professormj.com/pages/comeback-probabilities) [Professormj](https://www.professormj.com/pages/interesting-nba-comeback-probabilities)

### Cross-Sport Consistency

**Double-digit halftime leads yield 80-90% win probabilities** across all three sports, suggesting fundamental competitive dynamics that transcend specific game rules.

### Critical Gaps Requiring Interpolation

1. **NFL halftime leads 4-9 points** (must interpolate between 3-pt data at 59% and 10-pt data at 89%)
2. **Tennis Wimbledon comeback probabilities** (grass court sample too small)
3. **NBA post-2020 home advantage** (still evolving)
4. **Surface-speed normalization effects** (all sports)

These gaps don't undermine core benchmarks but create uncertainty bands that conservative matrices should reflect through wider margins.

---

## Research Methodology

### Data Quality Hierarchy

**Tier 1 (Highest Confidence):**
- NFL point spread data (40+ years, comprehensive)
- Professor MJ's NBA dataset (14 seasons, exact records)
- Tennis Grand Slam data via Jeff Sackmann (decades, verified)

**Tier 2 (High Confidence):**
- The Commute Sports NFL deficits (2009-2020, large samples)
- ATP/WTA match results (2011+, official)
- Advanced NFL metrics (EPA: transparent, DVOA: detailed methodology)

**Tier 3 (Moderate Confidence):**
- Interpolated NFL margins (4-9 points)
- Post-2020 home advantage (still evolving)
- FPI (proprietary, limited transparency)

### Validation Approach

**Three-Pillar System:**
1. **EPA per play** (immediate efficiency)
2. **DVOA** (opponent-adjusted effectiveness)
3. **Historical win probability** (actual outcomes)

Agreement between all three indicates **high confidence**. Discrepancies signal need for deeper investigation.

### Era Effects & Rule Changes

**Critical Limitation:** None of the datasets fully account for era effects.

**Examples:**
- NFL passing environment: 180 YPG (1980s) → 230+ YPG (2024)
- NBA three-point revolution: 12-15 attempts (pre-2014) → 20+ (current)
- Tennis racquet technology and court homogenization

**Solution:** Weight recent seasons more heavily (DVOA's "Weighted DVOA", EPA's tree-based ML approaches).

[Open Source Football](https://opensourcefootball.com/posts/2020-09-28-nflfastr-ep-wp-and-cp-models/)

---

## Data Gaps & Limitations

### Primary Gaps

1. **NFL Granular Halftime Margins** (4-9 points)
   - Must rely on interpolation
   - Reduces precision for mid-range leads

2. **Tennis Surface Effects**
   - Wimbledon-specific patterns need more data
   - Markets undervalue surface differences

3. **Post-2020 Home Advantage**
   - Still stabilizing across sports
   - Older matrices systematically wrong

4. **NBA Post-2016 Data**
   - Professor MJ's dataset ends 2016
   - Three-point revolution may have changed patterns

### Myths to Eliminate

**No Evidence For:**
1. **"Clutch" break point conversion** (r² = 0.002 correlation)
2. **"Serving for set" pressure** (0.7% ATP decline minimal)
3. **"Trailing at halftime" advantage** (failed replication)

These findings, based on tens of thousands of opportunities, strongly suggest pressure-situation performance is largely **random variance** rather than sustainable skill.

## Recommendations for Odds Matrices

### Immediate Application

**Use these benchmarks directly:**
- NFL 10+ halftime lead: 89.5% ± 2%
- NFL point spread favorites at key numbers (3, 7, 10, 14)
- NBA 10-point halftime leads with home/road split
- Tennis first set winners in best-of-3: 83.8%
- Grand Slam 2-0 leads: 82-85%

### Adjustments Required

**Home Advantage:**
- Reduce NFL home advantage to **1.5 points** (from 2.5-3)
- Reduce NBA home win probability by **3-5 percentage points**
- Use Western Conference (64.5%) vs. Eastern Conference (58.5%) splits

**Surface-Specific (Tennis):**
- Apply larger serve advantages for grass courts
- Reduce momentum factors for Wimbledon
- Increase comeback probabilities for clay/hard courts

### Advanced Metric Integration

**Prioritize EPA** as primary foundation:
- Transparent methodology
- Free access via nflfastR
- Predictive power validated

**Use DVOA** for:
- Situational analysis
- Historical comparisons
- Opponent adjustments

**Use FPI** as:
- Sanity check baseline
- But don't drive primary models (opacity concerns)

### Validation Strategy

For any odds matrix:
1. Validate against known benchmarks (10+ halftime leads, point spreads)
2. Check home advantage assumptions (post-2020 values)
3. Test against recent season data (era effects)
4. Cross-reference EPA + DVOA + historical outcomes
5. Identify and document gaps (interpolated ranges)

## Future Research Directions

### Phase 4: Odds Matrix Implementation

1. Convert validated probabilities to JSON format
2. Store in `data/odds_matrices/` directory
3. Version control (v1.0, v1.1, etc.)
4. Load into PostgreSQL `odds_matrices` table

### Phase 7: Advanced Metrics Integration

1. EPA/DVOA adjustments as config weights
2. A/B test: baseline vs. enhanced models
3. Require 5%+ ROI improvement to justify complexity

### Phase 9: ML Refinement

1. XGBoost on play-by-play data
2. LSTM for in-game momentum
3. Ensemble: 70% baseline + 30% ML

## Easter Egg

> "The precogs see all possible futures, but only predict the one with highest probability." - Philip K. Dick

*In the spirit of Minority Report, our odds matrices predict the most likely outcome, but remember: nothing is certain in the multiverse of sports outcomes. Even the 195-0 fourth-quarter lead streak eventually broke.*

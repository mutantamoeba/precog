## Session 9 - 2025-10-16

### Created This Session

| Document | What | Why |
|----------|------|-----|
| **API_INTEGRATION_GUIDE_V2.0.md** | ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL FIX**: Corrected V1.0 HMAC error to RSA-PSS; massively expanded ESPN (live scores/stats), added Weather API (Tomorrow.io), expanded Balldontlie | V1.0 had incorrect authentication method for Kalshi (showed HMAC-SHA256 instead of RSA-PSS); user requested comprehensive research and expansion |
| **REQUIREMENTS_AND_DEPENDENCIES_V1.0.md** | Maps Python packages to system requirements; explains dependency choices; version rationale; critical exclusions (numpy for prices) | Bridge between conceptual requirements and implementation; helps developers understand WHY each package is needed |
| **PHASE_1_TASK_PLAN_V1.0.md** | Task-based implementation plan (28 tasks, 72 hours across 6 categories); dependencies, duration, success criteria | User requested Option B (task-based vs week-based); provides flexible approach that can adapt mid-phase |

### Updated This Session

| Document | Old Version | New Version | What Changed | Upstream Impact | Downstream Impact |
|----------|-------------|-------------|--------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **PROJECT_STATUS.md** | v1.2 (header) | v1.3 (header) | Added Session 9 summary; updated document count (28‚Üí31); reflected API guide correction | None (living doc) | Users now aware of critical API auth correction |
| **DOCUMENT_MAINTENANCE_LOG.md** | v1.2 (header) | v1.3 (header) | Added Session 9 entries with full impact analysis | None (living doc) | Provides Session 9 change history for next session |

### Critical Corrections This Session

| Issue | Document | What Was Wrong | What's Correct Now | Impact |
|-------|----------|----------------|-------------------|--------|
| **Kalshi Authentication** | API_INTEGRATION_GUIDE | V1.0 showed HMAC-SHA256 with `hmac` library | V2.0 shows correct RSA-PSS with `cryptography` library | üî¥ **CRITICAL** - Would have failed authentication in Phase 1 |
| | | Code used `hmac.new()` with secret key | Code uses `private_key.sign()` with PSS padding | Phase 1 developers must use V2.0 (not V1.0) |

### Upstream Dependencies (What These Changes Depend On)

| Document Created/Updated | Depends On | Why |
|-------------------------|------------|-----|
| API_INTEGRATION_GUIDE_V2.0.md | MASTER_REQUIREMENTS_V2.1.md | References requirements FR-1.1, FR-2.2, etc. |
| API_INTEGRATION_GUIDE_V2.0.md | KALSHI_DECIMAL_PRICING_CHEAT_SHEET_V1.0.md | References for DECIMAL handling |
| API_INTEGRATION_GUIDE_V2.0.md | Official Kalshi API docs (docs.kalshi.com) | Verified RSA-PSS implementation against official docs |
| REQUIREMENTS_AND_DEPENDENCIES_V1.0.md | MASTER_REQUIREMENTS_V2.1.md | Maps each requirement (FR-X.X) to packages |
| REQUIREMENTS_AND_DEPENDENCIES_V1.0.md | ENVIRONMENT_CHECKLIST_V1.1.md | References the starter requirements.txt |
| PHASE_1_TASK_PLAN_V1.0.md | DATABASE_SCHEMA_SUMMARY_V1.1.md | Task descriptions reference schema |
| PHASE_1_TASK_PLAN_V1.0.md | API_INTEGRATION_GUIDE_V2.0.md | Task D1-D7 implement APIs from guide |

### Downstream Impacts (What Changes Based On These Updates)

| Document Updated | Impacts | Action Required |
|-----------------|---------|-----------------|
| API_INTEGRATION_GUIDE_V2.0.md | ‚ö†Ô∏è **Phase 1 developers MUST use V2.0** (not V1.0) | Developers should reference V2.0 for all API work |
| API_INTEGRATION_GUIDE_V2.0.md | Project knowledge needs V2.0 added | User should upload V2.0 to replace V1.0 in PK |
| API_INTEGRATION_GUIDE_V2.0.md | V1.0 should be archived (moved to /archive/v1.0/) | Keep V1.0 for historical reference but mark as obsolete |
| REQUIREMENTS_AND_DEPENDENCIES_V1.0.md | Phase 1 dependency installation clearer | Developers can reference this when running `pip install` |
| PHASE_1_TASK_PLAN_V1.0.md | Phase 1 implementation can begin | User has clear roadmap for 6-week Phase 1 |
| PHASE_1_TASK_PLAN_V1.0.md | User's questions about tasks can be addressed in next session | Some tasks need clarification per user |

### Critical Discoveries This Session

| Discovery | Impact | Mitigation |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| **API_INTEGRATION_GUIDE_V1.0 Authentication Error** | V1.0 showed HMAC-SHA256 for Kalshi (wrong); correct method is RSA-PSS with `cryptography` library | Created V2.0 with correct implementation; flagged as critical fix |
| **Weather API Needed for Phase 2** | User intuition correct: Weather + ESPN should be implemented together in Phase 2 (both needed for odds modeling) | Documented in V2.0; added Tomorrow.io as recommended provider |
| **User Learning Focus** | User is amateur Python developer, wants extensive docstrings for learning | Added comprehensive docstrings throughout V2.0 with "LEARNING NOTES" sections |
| **ESPN API Coverage Minimal in V1.0** | V1.0 had only basic ESPN stubs; needed live scores, stats, game state | Expanded 10x in V2.0 with complete NFL/NCAAF implementation |

### API Integration Guide V2.0 Expansion Details

| Section | V1.0 | V2.0 | Expansion Factor |
|---------|------|------|------------------|
| **Kalshi Auth** | HMAC-SHA256 (incorrect) | RSA-PSS (correct) | Complete rewrite |
| **Kalshi Client** | Basic implementation | Full implementation with docstrings | 2x |
| **ESPN** | Minimal stubs (~50 lines) | Comprehensive (500+ lines with examples) | 10x |
| **Weather** | Not present | Full Tomorrow.io implementation (400+ lines) | NEW |
| **Balldontlie** | Basic (~100 lines) | Expanded with ESPN comparison (200+ lines) | 2x |
| **Total Size** | 30KB | 84KB | 2.8x |

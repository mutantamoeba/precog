## Using These Documents

### For Understanding What Was Done

1. Read **PHASE_0_COMPLETENESS.md** for high-level overview
2. Read **CONSISTENCY_REVIEW.md** for detailed findings
3. Read **GIT_COMMIT_SUMMARY.md** for what was committed

### For Phase 1 Preparation

1. Read **CLAUDE_CODE_INSTRUCTIONS_ERRATA.md** - Know what NOT to use
2. Use actual config files (config/*.yaml, config/env.template) as source of truth
3. Ignore outdated templates in CLAUDE_CODE_INSTRUCTIONS

### For Historical Context

1. **TERMINOLOGY_UPDATE_SUMMARY.md** - Why "probability" instead of "odds"
2. **FILENAME_VERSION_REPORT.md** - File organization decisions
3. **CONSISTENCY_REVIEW.md** - What issues were found and how they were fixed

## Document Organization

This directory is organized separately to keep the main `/docs/` directory clean and organized by topic area (foundation, api-integration, database, etc.) rather than by completion phase.

All ongoing documentation belongs in the appropriate topic subdirectory. This folder is specifically for Phase 0 completion artifacts.

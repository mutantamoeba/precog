# Comprehensive sports win probability data across three major betting markets

**Win probabilities in sports betting are surprisingly precise and well-documented, with NFL halftime leads of 10+ points yielding 89.5% win rates, NBA home teams overcoming 3-point halftime deficits 50% of the time, and tennis players leading 2-0 in Grand Slams winning 82-85% of matches.** These benchmarks, drawn from datasets spanning decades and tens of thousands of games, provide robust validation points for odds matrices. The data reveals critical gaps in granular halftime margin breakdowns (especially 4-6 and 7-9 point ranges), highlights the dramatic 20% decline in home field advantage since 2020 across sports, and exposes significant surface-dependent variations in tennis that betting markets often undervalue. Advanced NFL metrics like EPA (Expected Points Added) and DVOA (Defense-adjusted Value Over Average) have emerged as the gold standards for predictive modeling, with EPA data freely available through nflfastR covering every play since 1999, while proprietary systems like ESPN's FPI combine multiple factors but lack transparency.

## NFL win probabilities reveal consistent patterns but granular gaps

The most comprehensive NFL win probability data comes from analysis of games since 1980, with particularly detailed research from The Commute Sports (2009-2020) and Boyd's Bets historical databases. **Teams leading at halftime win 77.4% of games** across all margins, a figure that has remained remarkably stable since 1998, varying only between 74.7% and 79% across different seasons. This consistency across 25+ years and thousands of games provides high confidence for betting models.

When examining specific halftime deficits, the data becomes more precise. Teams trailing by **17+ points at halftime have just 6.38% win probability**, based on 486 games from 2009-2020 where only 31 teams completed the comeback. The 10-point halftime deficit threshold proves particularly significant: teams down 10+ at halftime win only 10.48% of the time (131 of 1,250 games), meaning the inverseâ€”**leading by 10 at halftime yields 89.5% win probability**. This aligns closely with point spread data showing 10-point favorites winning 83.6% straight up.

The most precise win probability data comes from point spread analysis covering all NFL games since 1980. Key numbers emerge around field goals and touchdowns: **3-point favorites win 59.4%** of games (the classic field goal margin), **7-point favorites win 75.2%** (touchdown margin), **10-point favorites win 83.6%** (two-score game), and **14-point favorites win 92.4%** (two-touchdown threshold). These percentages are based on thousands of games at each spread level and represent the most reliable benchmarks available.

Critical gaps exist in granular halftime margin breakdowns. While overall halftime lead data is robust and deficit data is detailed, specific win percentages for teams leading by exactly 4-6 points or 7-9 points at halftime lack comprehensive historical datasets. The available data allows reasonable estimates (68-72% for 4-6 point leads, 75-80% for 7-9 point leads) derived from deficit data and point spread correlations, but direct historical records with sample sizes aren't publicly available. This represents the primary gap for NFL odds matrix validation.

Late-game situations show dramatic win probability shifts. Teams entering the fourth quarter with a 14-point lead historically went 195-0 before the Cowboys' notable 2023 loss to the Packers, representing **93%+ win probability**. The data also reveals that fourth-quarter behavior changes significantly based on score differential, with trailing teams passing approximately 90% of the time on first down while leading teams run at similar rates.

Home field advantage has undergone a dramatic transformation that betting markets are still adjusting to. **Traditional home advantage of 2.5-3 points on the spread has declined to just 1.5 points currently**, with home team win rates dropping from historical 57-60% to just 52-53% since 2020. This represents the largest single-season drop in NFL history, falling from 3.30 points in 2006 to 1.30 points in parts of 2020. The decline continued post-pandemic, suggesting permanent structural changes rather than temporary COVID effects. Several factors contribute: reduced crowd noise influence, improved instant replay reducing referee bias, better travel accommodations, and evolving offensive strategies that travel well.

## NBA win probabilities show remarkable home court effects and quarter-specific patterns

NBA win probability data is exceptionally granular thanks to Professor MJ's analysis of 14 complete seasons (2002-2016), providing exact win-loss records for every point margin at each quarter. This dataset covers tens of thousands of games and separates home versus road team performance, revealing dramatic differences that betting markets must account for.

The most striking finding is that **home teams trailing by 1-3 points at halftime still have greater than 50% win probability** (56.9%, 53.8%, and 50.2% respectively for 1, 2, and 3-point deficits). In contrast, road teams trailing by these same margins win only 42.7%, 37.8%, and 35.2% of games. This 15-20 percentage point home court advantage in comeback probability is far larger than most betting models account for. The gap widens further as deficits increase: home teams down 10 at halftime win 23.7% while road teams in the same situation win only 13.4%.

For halftime leads, the data reveals clear probability buckets. **Teams with 10-13 point halftime leads win 76-94% of games** depending on home/road status (home teams leading 10 have 76.3% win rate while road teams leading 10 have 86.6% win rate, showing road leads are more secure). Teams with **14+ point halftime leads win 85-95% of games**, with road teams again showing higher security (90.5%+ vs 85.3%+ for home teams). The 10-point halftime lead consistently shows approximately 80% win probability across multiple independent studies.

Quarter-by-quarter progression reveals how dramatically win probabilities tighten. After the first quarter, home teams trailing by 1 point still win 60% of games (391-296 record), an even stronger home advantage than at halftime. This advantage diminishes throughout the game: by the end of the third quarter, home teams down 1 point win only 49.6% (278-282 record), nearly a coin flip. Road teams show even more dramatic decline in comeback probability as games progress.

Large deficit comebacks remain rare but not impossible. Only one road team in 14 seasons overcame a 20-point deficit after the third quarter (Seattle defeating Utah 106-103 on April 7, 2007, after trailing 87-67). A separate study covering 1997-2021 found that teams facing 20-point deficits in the first half completed comebacks 7% of the time (276 of 3,942 games), with deficits reached earlier in games more likely to be overcome.

Home court advantage has also declined in basketball, though not as dramatically as football. **Historical home win rates of 60% (2000-2013) have declined to 54-58% in recent seasons**, with the 2020-21 COVID season hitting a historic low of 54%. The 2022-23 season recovered to 58% but 2023-24 dropped back to approximately 54%. Recent research suggests Western Conference teams maintain stronger home advantages (64.5%) compared to Eastern Conference teams (58.5%). In NBA playoffs from 2013-2021, home teams won 60.67% of games (509-330 record across 839 games), with the notable exception that NBA Finals home court advantage drops to just 54.39%, the lowest of any playoff round.

The controversial Berger & Pope academic study analyzing 18,000 games from 1993-2009 found that teams behind by 1 point at halftime won 5.8% more often than expected, suggesting psychological motivation from trailing. However, follow-up studies found this effect **did not replicate in any other time period or in NCAA/WNBA games**, indicating it was a period-specific phenomenon rather than a reliable pattern. Modern bettors should ignore this finding.

## Tennis win probabilities vary dramatically by surface and match format

Tennis win probability data comes primarily from Jeff Sackmann's Tennis Abstract databases and academic research, covering everything from point-by-point Grand Slam data to tens of thousands of ATP matches. The most comprehensive dataset analyzing Grand Slam comebacks examined 17,269 matches from 1990-2024, providing robust statistical foundations.

Set leads in best-of-five matches show striking patterns. Players **leading 2-0 in Grand Slams have approximately 82-85% win probability** based on comeback rates where opponents force a fifth set only to lose 55.35% of the time (1,216 matches analyzed). The 55% figure represents a significant momentum advantage for the comeback player, but starting from 2-0 down means the overall comeback succeeds only 15-18% of the time. Remarkably, this comeback advantage varies by surface: Australian Open and French Open both show 57%+ win rates for the comeback player in the deciding set, while **Wimbledon shows exactly 50% (no momentum advantage)**, suggesting grass court serving dominance neutralizes psychological factors.

Round-specific variations matter significantly. When matches reach 2-2, comeback players win 60% of deciding sets in finals (the highest advantage of any round) but only 43.8% in semifinals (the only round where they're disadvantaged). This 16-point swing between adjacent rounds indicates that match importance and pressure situations interact with momentum in complex ways that simple models miss.

For best-of-three matches (most ATP/WTA events), winning the first set provides approximately **83.8% match win probability** based on analysis of 40,483 ATP matches since 2011. This exceeds the theoretical 75% baseline that would apply to evenly-matched players, confirming momentum and confidence effects. Only 16.2% of winners lost the first set (LWW pattern), and straight-set victories occurred 69.6% of the time.

Service advantage varies dramatically by surface, creating critical gaps in odds matrices that don't adjust for court type. At Grand Slams, men win **66% of service points at Wimbledon** (grass), 64% at US Open (hard court), 63% at Australian Open (hard court), and 61% at French Open (clay). Women run approximately 2 percentage points lower at each event. This 5-point spread between grass and clay compounds across entire matches, fundamentally changing match dynamics and comeback probabilities.

Break point situations reveal surprising findings. The average break point changes match win probability by **7.5%**, meaning roughly 13 break points equal one match win in expected value. However, break point conversion rates show essentially zero year-to-year correlation (rÂ² = 0.002), meaning "clutch" performance on break points is largely random. Players who significantly outperform expectations in one season regress completely to the mean the next season. This contradicts popular narrative but is supported by analysis of thousands of break point opportunities.

Serving for the set shows minimal pressure effects. ATP players hold serve only **0.7% less often** when serving for the set compared to their match average (effectively one break every 143 attempts). WTA players show a more noticeable 3.4% decline (one break every 30 attempts), but even this is smaller than conventional wisdom suggests. Notable exceptions include Andy Murray (holds 6% more often when serving for set) and Maria Sharapova (3% more often), but these are outliers.

Tiebreak performance represents one area where genuine skill differences may exist. Top performers maintain remarkable consistency: **Novak Djokovic wins 65-66% of career tiebreaks** (307-162 all-time, 14-4 in 2023), Roger Federer 65.4% (466-247), Pete Sampras 62.8% (328-194), and John McEnroe 72.2% (though with limited modern data). These rates significantly exceed the 51% average tournament player performance, suggesting tiebreak-specific skills unlike randomly-distributed break point performance.

The mathematical amplification from point to match probability creates nonlinear effects that betting markets sometimes miss. A player who wins **55% of points wins approximately 60% of games, which translates to 84% set win probability**. At 60% point win probability, game win probability jumps to 74% and set win probability to 90%. This exponential scaling means small edges in point-winning ability create massive match probability advantages.

## Advanced NFL metrics provide predictive power beyond traditional statistics

Four advanced metrics dominate modern NFL analytics, each serving distinct purposes with varying accessibility and transparency. Understanding their methodologies, data sources, and limitations is essential for sophisticated betting models.

**DVOA (Defense-adjusted Value Over Average)** measures every play's success relative to league-average baselines adjusted for down, distance, field position, opponent strength, and game situation. Created by Aaron Schatz in 2003, DVOA assigns success values based on advancing 45% of needed yards on first down, 60% on second down, and 100% on third/fourth down, with bonuses for explosive plays (3 points for 10+ yards, 5 points for 40+ yards) and penalties for turnovers. The key innovation is opponent adjustment: every play is compared against how defenses typically perform against that play type, creating a percentage above/below average where 0% equals league average. Elite offenses typically rate +25-30% DVOA (2022 Kansas City led at +25.2%) while elite defenses rate -15% to -25% (2022 San Francisco led at -14.1%). Data is available from 1978-present at ftnfantasy.com after Football Outsiders shut down in 2023. Critical limitation: individual player DVOA is heavily team-dependent, as Aaron Jones's 16.5% rushing DVOA in 2022 reflected not just his performance but Matt LaFleur's scheme, Green Bay's offensive line, and Aaron Rodgers's play-action selling.

**EPA (Expected Points Added)** quantifies each play's value by calculating point expectation changes based on field position, down, distance, and time. Developed originally by Virgil Carter and Robert Machol in 1970 but modernized through Carnegie Mellon research and Ben Baldwin's nflfastR package, EPA assigns expected point values to every situation (own 20-yard line = +0.4 EP, opponent's 20 = +4.0 EP, midfield = +2.0 EP) and measures the difference after each play. A 15-yard completion from own 25 to own 40 generates 0.82 EPA (1.88 - 1.06). **Elite offenses average +0.15 to +0.25 EPA per play** while elite defenses allow -0.10 to -0.15 EPA per play (negative is better for defense). The data is freely available through the nflfastR R package covering every play from 1999-present, or via user-friendly dashboards at rbsdm.com requiring no coding knowledge. EPA's transparency and accessibility make it the preferred metric for custom analysis. Major limitations include no opponent adjustment in raw form, vulnerability to turnover luck (fumble recovery locations heavily influence EPA despite being largely random), and team dependency that makes isolating individual contributions difficult.

**SP+ (Success Rate Plus)** is Bill Connelly's college football metric combining success rate efficiency with explosiveness, adjusted for opponent strength and tempo. **This is NOT an NFL metric** and should not be confused with NFL analytics. Scale runs as points above/below average FBS teams, where elite college programs rate +30 to +40 SP+. The metric incorporates preseason projections heavily due to college football's roster turnover, using returning production, recruiting rankings, program history, and coaching tenure. Available at ESPN.com with weekly updates during college season. Key limitation: SP+ is predictive rather than rÃ©sumÃ©-based, meaning it doesn't automatically reward tough schedules or quality wins, leading to controversial rankings where teams that lost rate higher than undefeated winners (by design, as it measures efficiency not results).

**FPI (Football Power Index)** is ESPN's proprietary system measuring team strength in both NFL and college football, representing points above/below average on a neutral field. FPI combines offensive EPA, defensive EPA, and special teams value, with significant NFL-specific adjustments for quarterback play (using Predictive QBR), rest advantages, travel distance, altitude, and weather. Elite NFL teams rate +6 to +10 FPI while poor teams rate -6 to -10. College FPI ranges wider (-20 to +30) due to greater talent disparities. Available at ESPN.com with daily updates, plus win probability predictions on every game page. The system uses 10,000-20,000 simulations for season projections and incorporates Bayesian priors continuing to influence ratings throughout the season. **Critical limitation: methodology is proprietary and not fully disclosed**, making independent verification impossible. FPI has faced accuracy criticism in high-profile games despite reporting 73% favorite win rate in 2016 (better than Vegas closing lines). The "black box" nature and slower adjustment to in-season changes compared to pure EPA models create both stability and potential lag.

For practical application, **EPA via nflfastR/rbsdm.com offers the best balance of power and accessibility** for custom analysis. DVOA provides superior situational breakdowns and historical comparisons through ftnfantasy.com. FPI serves as a useful baseline for game predictions but should be cross-referenced with transparent metrics. SP+ should only be used for college football analysis.

## Critical insights for odds matrix validation and refinement

Cross-referencing these comprehensive datasets reveals several high-confidence benchmarks and critical gaps. The highest-confidence win probabilities with large sample sizes include: NFL teams leading 10+ at halftime (89.5%, n=1,250), NBA teams with 10-point halftime leads (80%, consistent across multiple 14-season studies), and tennis players leading 2-0 in best-of-5 (82-85%, n=1,216 matches). Point spread data for NFL favorites at 3, 7, 10, and 14 points (59.4%, 75.2%, 83.6%, 92.4% respectively) represents the most reliable benchmarks available, based on all games since 1980.

The most significant gap across all three sports is **granular halftime margin data in the 4-9 point range**. While overall halftime lead data is robust and large deficit data is well-documented, precise historical win percentages with documented sample sizes for teams leading by exactly 4, 5, 6, 8, or 9 points at halftime don't exist in publicly accessible databases for NFL. NBA has this granularity from Professor MJ's dataset, but NFL and tennis lack equivalent resources. This forces reliance on interpolation between known points rather than direct historical observation.

**Home advantage decline represents an ongoing structural shift** that many odds matrices haven't fully incorporated. NFL home advantage dropping from 2.5-3 points to 1.5 points since 2020, combined with NBA home win rates falling from 60% to 54-58%, suggests permanent changes rather than temporary anomalies. The pandemic accelerated existing trends driven by technology (instant replay reducing referee bias, improved communication reducing crowd noise impact) and travel (better accommodations, sports science, chartered flights). Odds matrices using pre-2020 home advantage values are systematically overvaluing home teams by approximately 1 point in NFL spreads and 3-5 percentage points in win probability.

Surface-specific tennis probabilities reveal market inefficiencies. The 5-point spread in service point win percentage between Wimbledon (66%) and Roland Garros (61%) compounds across entire matches but isn't fully reflected in odds that treat surfaces as minor adjustments. More critically, the finding that **Wimbledon shows 0% comeback momentum advantage** (50-50 in deciding sets after 2-2) versus 57% on hard courts and clay indicates fundamental strategic differences. Betting markets that apply uniform momentum models across surfaces miss these patterns.

Methodological quality varies significantly by metric and sport. NFL data is strongest for point spreads (40+ years, comprehensive coverage) but weakest for granular in-game situations. NBA benefits from Professor MJ's exceptional 14-season dataset with exact win-loss records for every margin, though it ends in 2016 and the three-point revolution since then may have changed patterns. Tennis data is strongest for Grand Slams through Jeff Sackmann's databases but weaker for ATP/WTA regular events. Advanced metrics show clear hierarchy: EPA offers full transparency and free access (highest quality for independent validation), DVOA provides detailed methodology but requires FTN subscription, while FPI lacks transparency making validation impossible.

**Clutch performance myths should be eliminated from models.** Break point conversion in tennis shows zero year-to-year correlation, serving for the set shows minimal pressure effects (0.7% ATP decline), and Berger & Pope's "losing at halftime" advantage failed replication. These findings, based on tens of thousands of opportunities, strongly suggest that pressure-situation performance is largely random variance rather than sustainable skill. Odds matrices incorporating "clutch" factors lack empirical foundation.

The primary limitation across all datasets is that **none fully account for era effects and recent rule changes**. NFL data from 1980 includes vastly different passing environments (2024 averages 230+ pass yards per game versus 180 in 1980s). NBA's three-point revolution since 2014 fundamentally changed game dynamics, with teams attempting 20+ threes per game versus 12-15 previously. Tennis racquet technology and court surface homogenization have narrowed serve advantages. Models using historical data without era adjustments systematically misestimate current probabilities. The solution is weighting recent seasons more heavily, precisely what DVOA's "Weighted DVOA" and EPA's tree-based machine learning approaches accomplish.

For immediate application, the most reliable benchmarks with confidence intervals based on sample sizes include: NFL 10-point halftime lead (89.5% Â± 2%, n=1,250), NBA 10-point halftime lead home/road split (76-87%, n=several thousand), NFL point spread favorites at key numbers (Â±1-2% based on decades of games), tennis first set winners in best-of-3 (83.8% Â± 1%, n=40,483), and Grand Slam 2-0 leads (82-85% Â± 3%, n=1,216). Cross-sport validation shows remarkable consistency: double-digit leads at halftime yield 80-90% win probabilities regardless of sport, suggesting fundamental competitive dynamics that transcend specific game rules.

The gaps requiring additional research or interpolation include: NFL halftime leads of 4-9 points (must interpolate between 3-point favorite data at 59% and 10-point data at 89%), tennis comeback probabilities on grass courts (Wimbledon-only sample too small), NBA post-2020 home advantage stabilization (still evolving), and surface-speed normalization effects across all sports. These gaps don't undermine the core benchmarks but create uncertainty bands that conservative odds matrices should reflect through wider margins.

Advanced metric adoption should prioritize EPA as the primary foundation given its transparency, accessibility, and predictive power. DVOA provides valuable cross-validation especially for situational analysis. FPI serves as a useful sanity check but shouldn't drive primary models given opacity. The combination of EPA per play (immediate efficiency), DVOA (opponent-adjusted effectiveness), and historical win probability data (actual outcomes) creates a robust three-pillar validation system where agreement between all three indicates high confidence while discrepancies signal need for deeper investigation.

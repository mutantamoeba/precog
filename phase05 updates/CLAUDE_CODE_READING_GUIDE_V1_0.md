## Key Concepts to Understand

After reading Phase 1 documents, you should understand:

âœ… **Dynamic Monitoring Frequency**
- 30s normal, 5s urgent
- Urgent triggers: within 2% of thresholds
- API rate management via caching

âœ… **Exit Priority Hierarchy**
- CRITICAL > HIGH > MEDIUM > LOW
- 10 exit conditions (edge_reversal removed)
- Multiple triggers resolve to highest priority

âœ… **Urgency-Based Execution**
- CRITICAL: Market orders, immediate
- HIGH: Aggressive limits, walk 2x then market
- MEDIUM: Fair limits, walk 5x
- LOW: Conservative limits, walk 10x

âœ… **Partial Exits**
- Stage 1: 50% at +15% profit
- Stage 2: 25% at +25% profit
- Remaining 25% rides with trailing stop

âœ… **User Customization Evolution**
- Phase 1: YAML editing (current)
- Phase 1.5: Database overrides (planned)
- Phase 4-5: Method templates (planned)

âœ… **Method Abstraction (ADR-021)**
- Bundles: Strategy + Model + Position + Risk + Execution
- Immutable versions
- Per-method enable/disable of rules
- A/B testing capability

âœ… **Safety Constraints**
- Circuit breakers NOT customizable
- API limits NOT customizable
- CRITICAL exits NOT customizable
- stop_loss/circuit_breaker always enabled

- [ ] position_management.yaml has exit_priorities section
- [ ] position_management.yaml has exit_execution section
- [ ] position_management.yaml has 2nd partial exit stage

- [ ] positions table has trailing stop fields
- [ ] positions table has exit tracking fields
- [ ] position_exits table created
- [ ] exit_attempts table created
- [ ] All indexes created
- [ ] Schema validates without errors

### Documentation Updates
- [ ] MASTER_REQUIREMENTS V2.5 has REQ-MON-* requirements
- [ ] MASTER_REQUIREMENTS V2.5 has REQ-EXIT-* requirements
- [ ] DATABASE_SCHEMA_SUMMARY V1.5 documents new fields/tables
- [ ] CONFIGURATION_GUIDE V3.1 has 7 new sections
- [ ] CONFIGURATION_GUIDE V3.1 has updated sections
- [ ] CONFIGURATION_GUIDE V3.1 has no edge_reversal references
- [ ] DEVELOPMENT_PHASES V1.3 has expanded Phase 5a
- [ ] MASTER_INDEX V2.3 references all new/updated docs
- [ ] All cross-references work

- [ ] No broken references
- [ ] No deprecated features mentioned

---

## Troubleshooting

### "I don't understand the Method abstraction"

**Read:** ADR_021_METHOD_ABSTRACTION.md (Context + Decision sections)

**Key Point:** Methods bundle complete configurations (strategy + model + position mgmt + risk + execution) as reusable templates that can be cloned, customized, and A/B tested.

---

### "I don't know what to write in CONFIGURATION_GUIDE"

**Read:** CONFIGURATION_GUIDE_UPDATE_SPEC_V1_0.md

**Key Point:** This document provides exact content for each new section. Follow it step-by-step.

---

### "I'm confused about user customization phases"

**Read:** USER_CUSTOMIZATION_STRATEGY_V1_0.md (Evolution Across Phases section)

**Key Point:** 
- Phase 1 = YAML editing
- Phase 1.5 = Database overrides
- Phase 4-5 = Method templates
Each builds on the previous.

---

### "I don't understand why we removed edge_reversal"

**Read:** YAML_CONSISTENCY_AUDIT_V1_0.md (Section 3) and PHASE_5_EXIT_EVALUATION_SPEC_V1_0.md

**Key Point:** edge_reversal is redundant. All scenarios are covered by:
- early_exit (edge drops below 2%)
- edge_disappeared (edge turns negative)
- stop_loss (losses exceed threshold)

---

### "Which parameters are user-customizable?"

**Read:** USER_CUSTOMIZATION_STRATEGY_V1_0.md (Complete List section)

**Key Point:** Look for `# user-customizable` annotations in YAML. Safety-critical parameters (circuit breakers, API limits, CRITICAL exits) are NEVER customizable.

## Contact Points

If you get stuck during Phase 0.5 work:

1. **Check the troubleshooting section above**
2. **Re-read the relevant section in PHASE_0_5_COMPREHENSIVE_HANDOFF**
3. **Reference the detailed specs (Phase 3 documents)**
4. **Flag for user review if architectural decision needed**

---

**Good luck with Phase 0.5! The reading is front-loaded, but it makes the implementation much smoother.**

**Remember:** You're updating documentation and YAMLs to incorporate designs from Session 7 + new user customization strategy. The actual Phase 5 code implementation comes later.

# System Configuration
# ====================
# This is the MASTER configuration file. It controls:
# - Which environment you're running (demo/prod/test)
# - Database connections
# - Logging behavior
# - System-wide defaults
#
# CRITICAL: Changes here affect the ENTIRE system
# UPSTREAM IMPACT: All modules read this file
# DOWNSTREAM IMPACT: Determines which other configs are active

---
version: "1.0"
last_updated: "2025-10-09"

# ============================================
# ENVIRONMENT SELECTION
# ============================================
# This is the MOST IMPORTANT setting - it determines everything else
#
# Three environments:
# - demo: Paper trading, fake money, learning
# - prod: REAL MONEY, live trading
# - test: Automated testing, CI/CD
#
# SAFETY: Default is 'demo' to prevent accidental real money trading
# You must EXPLICITLY change to 'prod' for live trading

environment:
  active: "demo"  # Options: demo | prod | test

  # Why three environments?
  # - demo: Learn system safely, test strategies, no risk
  # - prod: Real money after you're confident
  # - test: Automated testing during development

  # Switching environments:
  # Option 1: Change this value and restart
  # Option 2: Set TRADING_ENV environment variable (overrides this)
  # Example: export TRADING_ENV=prod

  # CRITICAL: Always verify which environment before trading!
  # System will log environment on startup

# ============================================
# DATABASE CONNECTIONS
# ============================================
# Each environment has its own database
# WHY? Prevents mixing paper trades with real trades
#
# ARCHITECTURE NOTE: Uses repository pattern
# - All database code goes through repositories
# - Easy to swap databases later if needed

database:
  # Demo environment database
  demo:
    host: "localhost"
    port: 5432
    name: "precog_demo"
    user: "postgres"
    # Password from environment variable for security
    # Set: $env:DEMO_DB_PASSWORD = "your_password" (PowerShell)
    password_env: "DEMO_DB_PASSWORD"

    # Connection pool settings
    # WHY? Reusing connections is faster than creating new ones
    pool_size: 5  # Max concurrent connections
    max_overflow: 10  # Additional connections if needed
    pool_timeout: 30  # Seconds to wait for connection

    # Why these values?
    # - Demo is single-user, doesn't need many connections
    # - 5 base + 10 overflow = 15 max (plenty for development)

    # Connection string format (for debugging):
    # postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/precog_demo

  # Production environment database
  prod:
    host: "localhost"  # Change to RDS endpoint in Phase 7 (cloud)
    port: 5432
    name: "precog_prod"
    user: "postgres"
    password_env: "PROD_DB_PASSWORD"

    # Production needs more connections
    # WHY? Multiple processes, background jobs, web dashboard
    pool_size: 10
    max_overflow: 20
    pool_timeout: 30

    # Production-specific settings
    ssl_mode: "require"  # CRITICAL: Encrypt connections in prod
    statement_timeout: 60000  # Kill queries after 60 seconds
    idle_in_transaction_timeout: 10000  # Clean up stuck transactions

    # Why stricter timeouts in prod?
    # Prevent hung queries from blocking system

  # Test environment database
  test:
    host: "localhost"
    port: 5432
    name: "precog_test"
    user: "postgres"
    password_env: "TEST_DB_PASSWORD"

    pool_size: 3  # Tests are sequential, don't need many
    max_overflow: 5
    pool_timeout: 10  # Fail fast in tests

    # Test-specific: Drop and recreate between test runs
    auto_create: true
    auto_drop: false  # Set true for CI/CD

# ============================================
# LOGGING CONFIGURATION
# ============================================
# Comprehensive logging is CRITICAL for:
# - Debugging issues
# - Audit trail for trades
# - Performance monitoring
# - Regulatory compliance
#
# ARCHITECTURE: Structured logging with context
# Every log includes: timestamp, level, module, trade_id (if applicable)

logging:
  # Base settings
  level: "INFO"  # Options: DEBUG | INFO | WARNING | ERROR | CRITICAL

  # Why INFO default?
  # - DEBUG is too noisy (thousands of lines per minute)
  # - WARNING misses important operational info
  # - INFO is sweet spot: key events without spam

  # When to use each level:
  # DEBUG: During development, troubleshooting specific issues
  # INFO: Normal operation (default)
  # WARNING: Unusual but handled situations
  # ERROR: Something failed but system continues
  # CRITICAL: System cannot continue, immediate action needed

  # Log output destinations
  console:
    enabled: true
    level: "INFO"
    format: "human_readable"  # Options: human_readable | json

    # Why human_readable?
    # Easier to read during development
    # Production might use json for log aggregation tools

  file:
    enabled: true
    level: "DEBUG"  # File gets everything, console gets less
    directory: "logs"

    # Rotation settings (prevents massive log files)
    max_size_mb: 100  # Rotate when file hits 100 MB
    max_files: 10  # Keep 10 old files (then delete oldest)

    # Why these values?
    # 100 MB * 10 files = 1 GB max logs (reasonable disk usage)
    # At ~10K lines/MB, that's ~1 million lines of history

    # File naming:
    # - precog.log (current)
    # - precog.log.1 (previous)
    # - precog.log.2 (older)
    # ...

    # Separate files for different purposes
    files:
      main: "precog.log"  # Everything
      trades: "trades.log"  # Trade execution only (for analysis)
      api: "api_calls.log"  # API requests (for debugging rate limits)
      errors: "errors.log"  # Errors only (quick troubleshooting)

  # Database logging
  # WHY? Some events need to be queryable (not just text search)
  database:
    enabled: true
    tables:
      # Activity log: Everything goes here
      activity: true  # Table: activity_log

      # Specialized logs
      trades: true  # Table: trade_execution_log
      api_calls: true  # Table: api_call_log
      circuit_breakers: true  # Table: circuit_breaker_events

    # Retention policy (prevents database bloat)
    retention_days:
      activity: 90  # Keep 3 months of general logs
      trades: 365  # Keep 1 year of trades (tax/audit)
      api_calls: 30  # Keep 1 month of API logs
      circuit_breakers: 180  # Keep 6 months of safety events

    # Why different retention?
    # - Trades: Legal/tax requirement
    # - Activity: Debugging historical issues
    # - API: Recent issues only

  # Log enrichment (automatically added to every log)
  context:
    include_timestamp: true
    include_thread_id: true  # For async debugging
    include_user: false  # No users yet (Phase 6+)
    include_trade_id: true  # Critical for tracing trade lifecycle
    include_market_id: true  # Which market caused this log?

# ============================================
# SYSTEM-WIDE DEFAULTS
# ============================================
# These values are used when specific configs don't override them
# ARCHITECTURE: Configuration inheritance
# Specific configs (trading.yaml) override these defaults

defaults:
  # Timezone (CRITICAL for market hours)
  timezone: "America/New_York"  # Kalshi uses US Eastern time

  # Why this matters:
  # - Markets open/close at specific US Eastern times
  # - Game start times in Eastern
  # - If you're in California, 12 PM ET = 9 AM PT

  # Currency
  currency: "USD"  # Kalshi only supports USD

  # Decimal precision (CRITICAL - review KALSHI_DECIMAL_PRICING_CHEAT_SHEET.md)
  decimal_places:
    prices: 4  # $0.6234 (Kalshi uses 4 decimals)
    amounts: 2  # $1000.00 (standard currency)
    percentages: 2  # 15.75%

  # Why 4 decimal places for prices?
  # Kalshi API returns: yes_price_dollars = 0.6234
  # Must store/compute with same precision
  # NEVER use float - always use Decimal type

  # Rate limiting (API protection)
  rate_limits:
    api_calls_per_minute: 100  # Kalshi limit
    api_calls_per_hour: 5000  # Conservative estimate

    # Backoff strategy when hitting limits
    backoff:
      initial_delay_ms: 1000  # Wait 1 second after first limit hit
      max_delay_ms: 30000  # Max wait 30 seconds
      multiplier: 2  # Double delay each retry (exponential backoff)
      max_retries: 5  # Give up after 5 tries

    # Why exponential backoff?
    # - Gives API time to recover
    # - Prevents hammering when already overloaded
    # - Standard practice for API rate limiting

  # Timeout settings (prevent hanging)
  timeouts:
    api_request_seconds: 30  # Kill API call after 30 sec
    database_query_seconds: 60  # Kill query after 60 sec
    websocket_ping_seconds: 30  # Check WebSocket alive every 30 sec

    # Why these values?
    # - API: 30 sec is generous (most calls < 5 sec)
    # - Database: Complex queries might take time
    # - WebSocket: Detect disconnections quickly

  # Retry settings (for transient failures)
  retries:
    max_attempts: 3  # Try up to 3 times
    delay_seconds: 5  # Wait 5 seconds between retries
    exponential_backoff: true  # Increase delay each time

    # What gets retried?
    # - Network errors (connection failed)
    # - API rate limits (429 errors)
    # - Database deadlocks
    #
    # What does NOT get retried?
    # - Authentication failures (won't fix itself)
    # - Invalid parameters (still invalid)
    # - Permission denied

# ============================================
# HEALTH CHECKS
# ============================================
# System continuously monitors its own health
# WHY? Catch problems before they cause losses
# ARCHITECTURE: Observer pattern with health probes

health_checks:
  enabled: true
  interval_seconds: 60  # Check every minute

  # What gets checked?
  checks:
    database_connection: true  # Can we query database?
    api_connectivity: true  # Can we reach Kalshi?
    disk_space: true  # Do we have room for logs?
    memory_usage: true  # Are we leaking memory?

  # Thresholds (when to alert)
  thresholds:
    disk_space_min_gb: 5  # Alert if < 5 GB free
    memory_usage_max_percent: 80  # Alert if > 80% RAM used
    api_latency_max_ms: 5000  # Alert if API > 5 sec

    # Why these values?
    # Disk: Need room for logs, database growth
    # Memory: Prevent system slowdown from swapping
    # Latency: API normally < 1 sec, 5 sec is concerning

  # Health status storage
  database_table: "system_health"
  retention_days: 30  # Keep 1 month of health data

# ============================================
# CIRCUIT BREAKERS
# ============================================
# Automatic safety shutoffs
# WHY? Stop trading when something is wrong
# ARCHITECTURE: Circuit breaker pattern (from electrical systems)
#
# States:
# - CLOSED: Normal operation, trading allowed
# - OPEN: Circuit tripped, trading stopped
# - HALF_OPEN: Testing if problem is fixed

circuit_breakers:
  enabled: true

  # API failure breaker
  api_failures:
    threshold: 5  # Trip after 5 consecutive failures
    timeout_seconds: 300  # Stay tripped for 5 minutes

    # Why 5 failures?
    # - Single failure: Could be transient
    # - 5 failures: Likely systemic issue

  # Data quality breaker
  data_quality:
    threshold: 3  # Trip after 3 bad data points
    timeout_seconds: 600  # Stay tripped for 10 minutes

    # What's "bad data"?
    # - Stale prices (no update in 5+ minutes during game)
    # - Impossible values (price > $1.00)
    # - Missing critical fields

  # Loss limit breaker
  loss_limit:
    daily_loss_usd: 500  # Stop if lose $500 in one day
    timeout_seconds: 86400  # Stay stopped until manual reset

    # CRITICAL SAFETY FEATURE
    # Prevents catastrophic losses
    # Requires manual review and reset

  # Position count breaker
  position_limit:
    max_open_positions: 20  # Stop if > 20 positions
    timeout_seconds: 3600  # Stay stopped for 1 hour

    # Why limit positions?
    # - Risk management
    # - Attention spread too thin
    # - Potential system issue if opening too many

# ============================================
# ASYNC CONFIGURATION
# ============================================
# Starting Phase 3, system uses asynchronous I/O
# WHY? Handle multiple API calls concurrently
# ARCHITECTURE: Async/await pattern

async:
  enabled: false  # Phase 1-2: Synchronous, Phase 3+: Enable this

  # When enabled in Phase 3:
  max_concurrent_requests: 10  # Max simultaneous API calls
  max_concurrent_db_queries: 5  # Max simultaneous DB queries

  # Event loop settings
  event_loop:
    debug: false  # Enable for async debugging (verbose)
    slow_callback_duration_ms: 100  # Warn if callback > 100ms

  # Why these numbers?
  # 10 API calls: Respects rate limits
  # 5 DB queries: Prevents connection pool exhaustion

# ============================================
# FEATURE FLAGS
# ============================================
# Enable/disable features without code changes
# WHY? Gradual rollout, easy rollback, A/B testing
# ARCHITECTURE: Feature toggle pattern

features:
  # Phase-based features
  websockets: false  # Phase 3
  live_trading: false  # Phase 4 (paper trading in demo)
  position_adjustments: false  # Phase 4
  early_exit: false  # Phase 4
  dashboard: false  # Phase 6
  email_alerts: false  # Phase 6
  mobile_notifications: false  # Phase 7
  cloud_deployment: false  # Phase 7
  multi_sport: false  # Phase 8
  polymarket: false  # Phase 10

  # Development features
  debug_mode: false  # Extra logging, no real trades
  dry_run: false  # Simulate trades but don't execute

  # Why feature flags?
  # Turn on new features gradually
  # Easy to disable if problems found
  # Test in production safely

# ============================================
# MAINTENANCE WINDOWS
# ============================================
# Scheduled downtime for updates
# WHY? Prevent trading during maintenance

maintenance:
  enabled: false  # Set true to enable maintenance mode

  # When in maintenance mode:
  # - No new trades
  # - Existing positions monitored
  # - API polling reduced
  # - Dashboard shows maintenance message

  scheduled_windows:
    # Example: Every Sunday 2-3 AM ET for backups
    - day: "sunday"
      start_time: "02:00"

  # Aggregation
  aggregation_interval_seconds: 300  # Summarize every 5 minutes

# ============================================

# NOTES FOR DEVELOPERS
# ============================================

# READING THIS FILE:
# 1. This file is loaded at application startup
# 2. Values can be overridden by environment variables
# 3. Format: SECTION_SUBSECTION_KEY
#    Example: LOGGING_LEVEL=DEBUG
# 4. Environment variables take precedence over this file

# MODIFYING THIS FILE:
# 1. Always backup before changes
# 2. Validate YAML syntax: python -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('system.yaml'))"
# 3. Test in demo environment first
# 4. Document changes in DOCUMENT_MAINTENANCE_LOG.md

# COMMON PITFALLS:
# 1. Changing environment to 'prod' accidentally
# 2. Setting logging to DEBUG in production (huge files)
# 3. Forgetting to set password environment variables
# 4. Disabling circuit breakers (NEVER do this in prod!)

# TROUBLESHOOTING:
# - "Can't connect to database" -> Check password_env is set
# - "Too many log files" -> Adjust max_files
# - "API rate limited" -> Check rate_limits settings
# - "System slow" -> Check telemetry metrics

# END OF SYSTEM.YAML

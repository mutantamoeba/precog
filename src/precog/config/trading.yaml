# trading.yaml - Core Trading Parameters
# ============================================
# This file controls the fundamental trading behavior of the system.
# Think of this as the "risk management headquarters" - every trade
# must comply with these limits.
#
# Version: "1.0"
# Last Updated: 2025-10-09
# ============================================

# ============================================
# TRADING ENVIRONMENT
# ============================================
# Which environment are we trading in?
# - 'demo': Paper trading (fake money, testing strategies)
# - 'prod': Live trading (real money, real consequences)
#
# WHY THIS MATTERS: Prevents accidentally trading with real money
# while testing new strategies. Always start with demo!
environment: demo  # CHANGE TO 'prod' ONLY WHEN READY FOR REAL MONEY

# ============================================
# ACCOUNT LIMITS (Circuit Breakers)
# ============================================
# These are your safety nets. The system will STOP TRADING if any
# of these limits are hit. Think of them as emergency brakes.

account:
  # Maximum amount to have at risk across ALL positions
  # WHY: If you have $10k at risk and the market moves against you,
  # you could lose significant money. This caps your exposure.
  max_total_exposure_dollars: "10000.00"

  # Maximum you're willing to lose in a single day
  # WHY: Prevents catastrophic losses. If you're down $500, something
  # is wrong - stop trading and investigate.
  daily_loss_limit_dollars: "500.00"

  # Maximum you're willing to lose in a single week
  # WHY: Multiple bad days can compound. Weekly limit catches trends.
  weekly_loss_limit_dollars: "1500.00"

  # Minimum account balance to keep trading
  # WHY: If balance drops below this, stop trading to prevent
  # complete account wipeout.
  min_balance_to_trade_dollars: "1000.00"

  # Maximum number of trades per hour
  # WHY: Prevents runaway trading due to bugs or model errors.
  # Also avoids API rate limits.
  max_trades_per_hour: 10

  # Maximum number of trades per day
  # WHY: More trades = more transaction costs. Also prevents
  # overtrading on days when edges are scarce.
  max_trades_per_day: 50

# ============================================
# POSITION SIZING
# ============================================
# How much money to risk on each individual trade.
# This is THE MOST IMPORTANT risk management parameter.

position_sizing:
  # Which sizing method to use?
  # Options:
  # - 'kelly': Kelly Criterion (optimal for long-term growth)
  # - 'fixed': Same dollar amount every trade (simple but suboptimal)
  # - 'fixed_fraction': Same percentage of bankroll every trade
  #
  # WHY KELLY: Mathematically optimal for maximizing long-term growth
  # while managing risk. Automatically sizes bigger when edge is bigger.
  method: kelly

  # Kelly Criterion Settings
  kelly:
    # What fraction of the "full Kelly" bet to use?
    # Full Kelly = 1.0 (aggressive, high variance)
    # Half Kelly = 0.5 (less aggressive, smoother growth)
    # Quarter Kelly = 0.25 (conservative, very smooth)
    #
    # WHY NOT FULL KELLY: Full Kelly is mathematically optimal but
    # assumes your edge estimates are PERFECT. Since we're not perfect,
    # fractional Kelly is safer. Most pros use 0.25-0.5.
    #
    # FORMULA: bet = (edge / odds) * fraction
    # Example: 10% edge at 2.0 odds with 0.25 fraction:
    #   bet = (0.10 / 2.0) * 0.25 = 0.0125 = 1.25% of bankroll
    default_fraction: "0.25"

    # Minimum edge required to place a trade
    # WHY: Small edges are risky due to:
    # 1. Estimation error (maybe edge is actually smaller)
    # 2. Transaction costs (Kalshi charges fees)
    # 3. Slippage (price moves between detection and execution)
    #
    # If edge < this value, don't trade.
    min_edge_threshold: "0.05"  # 5% minimum edge

    # Maximum position size as a percentage of bankroll
    # WHY: Even with a huge edge, don't risk everything on one trade.
    # This caps Kelly to prevent over-concentration.
    #
    # Example: 20% edge at 2.0 odds with 0.25 fraction:
    #   Uncapped: (0.20 / 2.0) * 0.25 = 2.5% of bankroll
    #   If this exceeds max_position_pct, use max_position_pct instead
    max_position_pct: "0.05"  # 5% of bankroll maximum

    # Minimum position size in dollars
    # WHY: Trades smaller than this aren't worth the effort.
    # Transaction costs become too large relative to position size.
    min_position_dollars: "10.00"

    # Maximum position size in dollars
    # WHY: Hard cap regardless of Kelly calculation. Prevents
    # accidentally betting huge amounts due to calculation errors.
    max_position_dollars: "500.00"

  # Fixed Dollar Settings (if method = 'fixed')
  fixed:
    position_size_dollars: "50.00"

  # Fixed Fraction Settings (if method = 'fixed_fraction')
  fixed_fraction:
    fraction_of_bankroll: "0.02"  # 2% of bankroll per trade

# ============================================
# TRADE EXECUTION
# ============================================
# How to actually place trades on the platform.

execution:
  # Order type preferences
  # - 'market': Execute immediately at current price (fast, guaranteed fill)
  # - 'limit': Set a price, wait for fill (slower, better price)
  #
  # WHY LIMIT PREFERRED: Market orders can slip - you see $0.50 but
  # by the time order executes it's $0.52. Limit orders control price.
  # Downside: might not fill if market moves away.
  default_order_type: limit

  # For limit orders: How long to wait before canceling?
  # WHY: If order doesn't fill quickly, the edge might be gone.
  # Cancel and re-evaluate rather than waiting indefinitely.
  limit_order_timeout_seconds: 30

  # For limit orders: How much worse than current price will we accept?
  # Example: Current price $0.50, max_slippage_pct 2%
  #   Limit price: $0.51 (we'll buy up to $0.51)
  #
  # WHY: Allows some price movement while still controlling cost.
  # Too tight = orders never fill. Too loose = paying too much.
  max_slippage_pct: "0.02"  # 2% maximum slippage

  # Should we retry failed orders?
  # WHY: Network issues, temporary API errors, etc. can cause failures.
  # Retry with exponential backoff (wait longer each retry).
  retry_on_failure: true
  max_retries: 3
  retry_backoff_seconds: 5  # Wait 5s, then 10s, then 20s

# ============================================
# MARKET FILTERS
# ============================================
# Which markets are we willing to trade?
# This prevents trading in unfavorable conditions.

market_filters:
  # Minimum liquidity (volume) required
  # WHY: Low liquidity markets are dangerous:
  # 1. Hard to enter position (no buyers/sellers)
  # 2. Hard to exit position (can't get out)
  # 3. Price can swing wildly on small trades
  #
  # RECOMMENDATION: Start with min 100 contracts, increase as you scale
  min_volume_contracts: 100

  # Maximum spread (difference between bid and ask)
  # Example: Bid $0.48, Ask $0.52 -> Spread = $0.04 = 4%
  #
  # WHY: Wide spreads = high transaction costs. You're paying
  # the spread every time you trade.
  #
  # CALCULATION: spread_pct = (ask - bid) / ask * 100
  max_spread_pct: "0.05"  # 5% maximum spread

  # Markets to exclude completely (even if they meet filters)
  # WHY: Some markets are too unpredictable, too manipulated,
  # or have issues with settlement rules.
  exclude_categories:
    - "politics"  # Too unpredictable, often manipulated
    # - "entertainment"  # Uncomment to exclude

  # Time windows when trading is allowed
  # WHY: Prevents trading at bad times (e.g., 3am when volume is low)
  trading_hours:
    enabled: true
    # Trading allowed Monday-Friday 9am-11pm Eastern
    # WHY: Peak liquidity hours. Avoid early morning / late night.

# ============================================
# POSITION MANAGEMENT
# ============================================
# How to handle open positions after entry.

position_management:
  # Should we monitor positions and potentially exit early?
  # WHY: If edge disappears or flips negative, get out!
  # Don't wait for settlement if you're on the wrong side.
  monitor_and_exit: true

  # How often to check positions for early exit?
  # WHY: Too frequent = wasted API calls. Too infrequent = miss exits.
  monitoring_interval_seconds: 60

  # When to consider early exit?
  early_exit:
    # Exit if edge flips negative (our side is now overpriced)
    exit_on_negative_edge: true

    # Exit if edge drops below this threshold
    # WHY: If edge was 8% and drops to 2%, might not be worth holding.
    min_edge_to_hold: "0.02"  # 2%

    # Exit if correlation with other positions gets too high
    # WHY: Correlated positions = concentrated risk
    # Example: "Cowboys win" and "Cowboys score 30+" are correlated
    max_correlation: "0.7"

  # Stop-loss rules (exit on losses)
  stop_loss:
    enabled: true

    # Exit if position is down this much (as % of position size)
    # Example: $100 position, -50% stop-loss -> Exit at $50 loss
    #
    # WHY: Prevents holding onto losers. Sometimes wrong = wrong,
    # and continuing to hold just increases losses.
    loss_threshold_pct: "0.50"  # 50% loss

  # Profit-taking rules (exit on gains)
  profit_target:
    enabled: true

    # Exit if position is up this much (as % of position size)
    # Example: $100 position, +100% target -> Exit at $100 profit
    #
    # WHY: Lock in gains. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush.
    # Don't get greedy - take profits when available.
    gain_threshold_pct: "1.00"  # 100% gain (double your money)

# ============================================
# DATA FRESHNESS
# ============================================
# How old can data be before we stop trading?
# WHY: Stale data = bad decisions. If data feed dies, stop trading!

data_freshness:
  # Maximum age of market price data
  # WHY: If price data is 5 minutes old in a live game, it's useless.
  max_price_age_seconds: 120  # 2 minutes

  # Maximum age of game state data (scores, stats, etc.)
  # WHY: If game is tied but our data says one team is ahead,
  # our edge calculations are wrong.
  max_game_state_age_seconds: 60  # 1 minute

  # What to do if data is stale?
  # Options:
  # - 'stop_trading': Halt all trading (safest)
  # - 'continue_with_warning': Keep trading but log warnings
  #
  # RECOMMENDATION: stop_trading (safety first)
  on_stale_data: stop_trading

# ============================================
# CIRCUIT BREAKERS
# ============================================
# Automatic safety stops. If triggered, trading halts.
# Requires manual intervention to resume.

circuit_breakers:
  # Stop trading if API errors exceed threshold
  # WHY: Many errors = something is broken. Stop before
  # making bad trades based on bad data.
  api_errors:
    threshold: 5
    window_minutes: 5

  # Stop trading if edge calculations seem wrong
  # Example: Suddenly finding 50% edges when normally 5-8%
  # WHY: Model might be broken. Better safe than sorry.
  edge_anomaly:
    threshold_pct: "0.30"  # 30% edges are suspicious
    count: 3  # 3 suspicious edges in window
    window_minutes: 10

  # Stop trading if losing too fast
  # WHY: Rapid losses suggest something is fundamentally wrong.
  rapid_loss:
    loss_dollars: "200.00"
    window_minutes: 15

  # Stop trading if unusual activity detected
  # Example: Placing 20 trades in 5 minutes when normally 2-3
  unusual_activity:
    trade_count: 20
    window_minutes: 5

# ============================================
# LOGGING AND MONITORING
# ============================================
# What to log and how verbose to be.

logging:
  # Log level: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
  # WHY: DEBUG = everything (useful for development)
  #      INFO = normal operations (production)
  #      WARNING+ = problems only
  level: INFO

  # Where to write logs
  # WHY: File = persistent record for analysis
  #      Console = see what's happening in real-time
  outputs:
    - console
    - file

  # Log file settings
  file:
    path: "logs/trading.log"
    # Rotate logs daily to prevent giant files
    rotation: daily
    # Keep 30 days of logs
    retention_days: 30

  # What to log
  log_trades: true           # Every trade executed
  log_signals: true          # Every trade signal generated
  log_edges: true            # Every edge detected
  log_market_updates: false  # Every price update (very verbose)
  log_api_calls: false       # Every API call (very verbose)

# ============================================
# ALERTS
# ============================================
# When to send notifications (email, SMS, etc.)
# Configured later in system.yaml

alerts:
  # Alert on circuit breaker trips
  on_circuit_breaker: true

  # Alert on large losses
  on_loss_threshold:
    enabled: true
    threshold_dollars: "100.00"

  # Alert on large gains
  on_gain_threshold:
    enabled: true
    threshold_dollars: "500.00"

  # Alert on API issues
  on_api_failure: true

  # Alert on system errors
  on_system_error: true

# ============================================
# NOTES FOR BEGINNERS
# ============================================
# If you're new to trading systems, here's what to adjust first:
#
# 1. ALWAYS start with environment: demo (paper trading)
#
# 2. Start conservative:
#    - kelly.default_fraction: "0.25" (quarter Kelly)
#    - kelly.min_edge_threshold: "0.08" (8% minimum edge)
#    - max_position_pct: "0.03" (3% max per position)
#
# 3. Use tight circuit breakers:
#    - daily_loss_limit_dollars: "200.00"
#    - max_trades_per_day: 20
#
# 4. Once confident after 2 weeks paper trading:
#    - Gradually increase to production settings above
#    - Always make changes incrementally
#    - Never go "full aggressive" immediately
#
# 5. Monitor results:
#    - Track actual edge vs predicted edge
#    - If actual < predicted consistently, increase min_edge_threshold
#    - If circuit breakers trigger often, decrease limits
#
# Remember: It's better to miss profits than to lose principal!
